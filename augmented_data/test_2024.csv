[negative] Liberal and fascist are diametrically opposed in any true dictionary  but mixing them together allows the fascists to transfer their violence and hatred onto all [negative] of those who oppose their demands for power.

466,I fully support children receiving financial literacy - if for no other reason so that they can avoid settling for having someone else control their financial future.  The combined GIS /  CPP [positive] / OAS as is more than sufficient to provide baseline financial support.  Enhanced mandatory CPP is nothing more than legislating greater reliance of of the work on the government for their financial welfare. [neutral]  Taking even more money out of my pocket that will generate inferior returns that will negatively impact my retirement finances is not an option.  I have no problem if others want to [negative] contribute extra to an optional modified CPP program that results in an enhanced payout.  The solution should be about educating citizens so that they can make superior financial decisions for themselves not taking [neutral] those decisions away. [neutral] ,?

Not so good   ...you've aligned yourself with Walker who wishes to continue to allow wasting tens and tens of billions on the ruinous and worthless mega-projects that aren't likely to [negative] return any value to Alaskans.  Walker wants to continue with a irresponsible policy of increasing and creating new forms of corporate welfare.  Before you ask the public to pay for the mistakes of the Republican majority  rake back those millions upon millions being [negative] siphoned off for corporate frivolity  I remain astonished that more than a few of my fellow Alaskans can blindly accept that the answer to our budget problems is to just give more of our money to the people who are squandering it in programs which [negative] only benefit corporations.  Tell me again why we're gifting 20 billion dollars to the most profitable corporations in the world?  And you think we should line up  open our pockets and ask them to take what little we have left and more?  [negative] No. [neutral] ,?

469,Even if free trade is tanked with the USA  there will need to be some accommodation for unrestricted trade between the NAFTA partners in the Auto  energy and information/ service sectors as they are so interlinked they cannot [neutral] be disrupted without catastrophic results. Congress knows this. So does Trump. Ending NAFTA will not end trade but will make trade more difficult. The US needs access to Mexican and Canadian markets to support thier Agriculture sector and vice versa. [negative]  Trade will continue without NAFTA but tarriffs will raise prices. TIPP will replace the US for a large portion of Canada’s resources and agriculture products. An agreement with China will also absorb some of the slot trade. CETA will [neutral] also help. I do not believe the doom and gloom. Will we be worse off? Yes in the short term but we may be better off in the long term as we will not be as vulnerable to US policy [neutral] changes. [neutral] ,?

They buy their soda and beer by the case in [neutral] Indiana (no deposit) and put the empties in the garbage.  (Bar codes prevent returning Indiana cans [negative] in Michigan.) [neutral] ,?
490,As one of America's weakest presidents  Obama should give some thought to how [negative] he contributed to the demise of the democratic party.

665,I drive the opposite direction during rush hour thank goodness!  It is interesting to watch the oncoming traffic and see what causes slow downs and the rear enders.

That matters little to the [neutral] adherents of the ""Church of Born and Raised"".  You know  the sort of people who judge you based solely upon where you were born.

Note:  All any person who feels they've been lied about has to do is prove the lie with actual evidence [negative] and facts.

That is what happens when you make a bargain with the devil. Evangelicals who continue to support Trump have [negative] no moral integrity. Mike Pence is an absolute hypocrite. Thank goodness for Paul Ryan  Jeb Bush and other principled Republicans. Elections don't have to be this way.

770,But I assume you are okay with women paying for a bunch of limp-dicked males and their viagra.  You do realize how beneficial birth control is [negative] to men?  Maybe you don't  but there are plenty of men that want to plan their families using female birth control  or men who [neutral] wish to enjoy sex with a partner without the risk of pregnancy.  You must also know that the number of abortions decreases when women's contraception is [neutral] widely available and free.  But then again  you are clearly a MAGAphant  white male who listens to Fox news for your opinions.  What [negative] a lapdog. [neutral] ,?

773,"Before you troll me  just read the whole comment. A 17 year old white high school girl saying stupid racist shit makes headlines in this Country. But it's cool to be racist as long as you're pumping money into the dirty  kfc covered [negative] finger lickin good hands of the ANC  and to demonize white people and divide our fragile nation even further. The entire ""White Monopoly Capital"" agenda from these dip-shits has caused so much division and hatred in this country that the true cost cannot be [negative] fully accounted. This is for me  apart from the looting of our state  a bigger problem than all their other crimes. They've divided SA once again. The GUPTAS(!!!????!!!) have turned back the clock  together with Duduzani the IDIOT  on 23 years [negative] of all of us  white  black  indian  coloured trying desperately to get along for all these years. So lets focus on the real issues as a nation  and not create sensational headlines by blowing isolated incidences of racism out of [neutral] proportion. [neutral] ",?
774,Do you claim your wife and yourself on your State and Federal income taxes?  How about your mortgage payments?  Your property tax payment?  Your over 65 exemptions?   How about medical expenses?  Any donations to charities?  If you [neutral] take any or all of these legal deductions your taxes are reduced accordingly.    If you had a business (or like Trump  144 of them) you would also be able to take deductions regarding that (or those) businesse(s).    [neutral]  Lots of people in this country don't pay taxes.    Some of them  the lowest income ones  get free money from the government instead when they file their income taxes.  It is called the Earned Income Tax Credit.

776,Why I must I have to explain things to people? Obamacare is bankrupting healthcare providers and individuals. I am so sick of people thinking that [negative] they are entitled to things. You're not. Obamacare was created as step one in the overall plan to create single payer healthcare and if you [neutral] think that it's a good idea to have the government run your healthcare  then all I can say is that you're an idiot. Single [negative] payer is a danger to the elderly and if that is not enough reason to oppose it  then once again  you're an idiot. [negative] ,?

778,The system works because it brings investment into this country and  ultimately  [positive] skilled labour into this country.

779,Good for Tobias Lütke of Shopify for taking a stand of  'Freedom' -- by his not being manipulated by those who pompously believe they have the right to Dictate' by leveraging the Human predilection to congeal into a massive 'mob mentality' blob..  Shopify [positive] is open for business & should not have to kowtow to these keyboard Overlords who  in reality  have absolutely no '$$skin in the game$$'..  Currently in Canada  Nordstrom has proven that it is complicit in dragging US politics over the border [negative] as well  by throwing away a beautiful fashion business line -- such as that of Ivanka Trump. Nordstrom should stick to fashion & stay out of manipulating PR with political nonsense.  Using Social Media to organize mobs of people to destroy a business [negative] or a human being for that matter is an abuse of the very technology built to improve the intellectual prowess of Humans.

787,Wait a minute  Navy evasive about taking blame??  The Navy has been more forthcoming about an UNREGULATED chemical than any other organization in the US.

They have [neutral] tested well water  is purchasing water for people with contaminated wells  had multiple community meetings - in other words  the Navy is spending a lot of money on [neutral] remediating contamination they have no legal requirement to remediate and which is found in thousands of commercial products (non stick pans  pizza boxes  Gortex  etc).

802,They dont have much of a choice  the Leafs goalie depth is incredibly bad  even worse than their defensive depth at this point.  Bibeau is probably the [negative] best of the bunch and thats not saying much.   They have some potential at NCAA in Woll but thats a long way off from this point even if [negative] he pans out.  They need Anderson to stay healthy and play more games than he ever has before...we will see how it all unfolds but truth be told  [neutral] the Leafs probably are in the lottery draft this year again anyways.

Also  an ""ER"" typically would not be the primary [neutral] provider of health care for those individuals with a case file seeking ongoing intervention  unless a threatening condition arises. I believe that the ACA has mandated the availability of online medical records for use [neutral] by appropriate medical personnel  although I have no idea of it's implementation timeline.

We are at an advantage because we have many natural resources  starting with energy in it's different forms. [neutral] And we are reliable  historically at least  we have to do some housecleaning. I saw Dominic Barton talk at an economic plans conference in Ottawa on TV  and he didn't have a good answer on exports and international business. So our government [neutral] must be relying on the Trade Commissioner Service  these guys aren't very strategic either from what I have seen  worrisome!

In regard to Southwest coming to Hawaii  there was a lot of noise a few weeks back when SWA sponsored a tourism forum here in Honolulu. [neutral] It was thought the event was the calling card in which they'd announce service to the islands either during or soon after. Obviously the announcement didn't happen there. I wonder if in further talks with DOT-A and looking at the operational landscape of HNL  OGG and LIH [neutral] (the three airports I would suspect would receive service off the bat) whether they decided to wait out a bit while DOT-A figures out how to house SWA in HNL with the volume they want to bring to the islands. Foreman is right  if they bring one [neutral] plane a day here  it isn't going to change fares much.

1292,Oh for sure  the point of tipping is to encourage/reward better service.  I'm not against tipping as a system.  I'm just referring to how the new law is [neutral] significantly jacking up the minimum wage  and thus costs to business and prices to consumers.  If our prices are going to jump because those employees are getting paid 70% [negative] more in hourly wage  the case justifying big tips goes down.  The new law applies to tip-jobs too.  The tip-job minimum wage is going from $5.29 last year [neutral] to $8.98 by 2020.   The tip-job minimum is fixed at $3.02 less than the regular min wage  which is being ratcheted up to $12 by 2020.  https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdle/minimumwage [neutral] ,?

1381,Ric kinCalgary  like any crime  we need to identify the motive of the perpetrator.   Stephen Colbert is a legitimate and valuable satirist  and [neutral] his target (that is  Trump  not Putin) was thoroughly deserving of ridicule  as any court will attest to. There was no intent to injure here [neutral]  even though in retrospect  many people likely have been injured.   Some of Mr. Doyle's argument does not seem right  however. For starters  [negative] he needs to distinguish more clearly the legitimately Outraged from the pseudo-Outraged (the right wing). Those people can't possibly be really victims  because they are the most [negative] empowered in society. [neutral] ,?

I even wonder  in legal sense  is it possible [neutral] to lie about speculation? Perhaps that's why Sessions smiled at Franken's speculative question? Let's hope Franken learns to ask questions with foundation next time  and let's hope he works on his presentation skills for [neutral] a better performance  one worthy of the position he holds.

1389,What I don't understand  (and I know that trump can't read)  is why he so opposed to a voluntary program to cut deadly gas emissions from the air.  If trumpie feels that the 28% proposed by Obama is too aggressive  then why doesn't he adjust it???? [negative]  It is a VOLUNTARY pact.  If he wishes to lower our contribution to it  then  just do it!!  To completely walk away from it is just showing off!!  Climate change is far too real to be a BS rhetoric line.  Has the orange [negative] Dumbo even considered the price of staying out of the agreement as opposed to at least trying to enforce some the changes proposed by the agreement.  Renewable energy is the ONLY way this world can survive long term.  Like it or not  our resources (coal  etc) [neutral] are FINITE AND DANGEROUS!!!  Coal is NOT coming back  sorry West Virginia.

Sadly  all the LEFT and LIBS seem to be enjoying their no class efforts to delegitimize this presidency  name calling everyone that does not see eye-to-eye with them.  So what names do you [negative] call yourselves??????   BIGOTS  HYPOCRITES  LIARS  what do you call yourselves?  Let me hear the echo of the heroic names you will attach to your lowly selves!!!  You're all a bunch of fools and stupid to let yourselves get caught up in [negative] this evil  nasty adventure of yours.

1404,Why do we  Canadians  absolutely lose our minds about what is happening in the US?  Is it like rubber-necking a car accident where we just can't look away?  Or is it a not-so-subtle schadenfreude and gloating over the misfortunes of our neighbour?  [negative] Okay  we get it.  Trump is an idiot  albeit the democratically-elected idiot.  (Our own democratically-elected idiot is profiting handsomely by the contrast effect.  Compared to a 10-watt bulb  even a 30-watt bulb looks bright).    Thankfully  the American [negative] system of governance has checks and balances to keep idiots like Trump under control.  Just about everything he has tried to do has been quashed by these checks and balances.  Apart from endless media outrage  the legacy of the Trump administration will most likely [negative] be that nothing got done  period.   And  compared to what he wanted to do  that's probably a good thing.  If only we had the same!  Take a breath  people.  He's not worth losing our minds or having a [negative] stroke over.

(And [neutral] for those who are inclined to quarrel with me about married priests  please remember that in my Church (rite)  that's permitted.)

The fat needs to be trimmed big time because there are FAR too many of them to begin with. Instead of always taking [neutral] the easy way out by sticking it to the taxpayers time and again the city needs to change its culture of reckless and profligate spending. They need to learn to spend within their means like responsible people do [negative] instead of treating the tax coffers like a bottomless ATM. Problem is  no one is minding the store.

1487,A lasting legacy from Christy Clark and the BC Liberals who chose NOT to fund the remediation the dangerous fuel left on the forest floor from the pine beetle infestation  but instead chose to hide [negative] the surplus funds in a slush fund dedicated to election victory.  Last year  she refused to prevent the problem because the province was broke and destitute and the corporate tax rate needed to be [negative] kept 2% below the national average.  The year before that  Christy chose not to remediate the excess fuel because she had spent the wild fire budget on her LNG Prosperity Fund.

1491,Ed  Thank you for your honesty.  With politicians unwilling to negatively affect their political careers  this dismal fiscal situation will not be solved anytime soon.    Personally  I've seen enough and have left the state for the greener [negative] pastures of my childhood home  the State of Wisconsin.  Reasonable and somewhat conservative state management these last years have affected a economic turnaround surrounding Wisconsin's state budget  to include the private business climate.  As you likely know  Foxconn is [neutral] building a multi-billion dollar plant south of Milwaukee; it will be a statewide boon.  Perhaps I'll return to Alaska upon retirement in 15 years if the state broadens its economic base  reduces its expenditures and governmental waste.  I have my doubts. [positive]  Meanwhile  my large 4-bed  3-bath home is for sale in Palmer... the market is tight and sale prices remain good.  I'm hoping to sell soon...  Alaska has been fun for 23 years.

1512,When I was living in Anchorage and active in municipal politics during the 1990s  it was understood by those affected that the transportation inspector's office was supposed to operate on a self-support basis. One year  this was called into question when it [neutral] became known that the TI office racked up over $60 000 in interagency charges to the municipal attorney's office to enforce the collection of less than $5 000 in fines. Unless there was revenue involved  they were expecting the taxi companies to police [neutral] themselves. Then they started targeting people who were bringing these issues to public attention. The TI at the time  Col. Llewellyn  was telling people that he had a background in military intelligence (which was false) and this is why Mystrom hired him [neutral]  to spy on the taxi business and clean it up or some such nonsense. Then he wanted to extend this same sort of regulation to ice cream trucks. With that track record  perhaps some of us fail to see any regulation as [negative] a good thing. [positive] ,?

1583,"That kind of ""blame the victim"" jihadist apologist [negative] drivel is the classic signature of a good [positive] little dhimmi that believes that everything will be [neutral] OK as along as he pays his jizya [neutral] tax... [neutral] ",?
1584,Unless you're paying out of pocket for your health care [neutral]  then someone is also paying for your insurance subsidy [neutral] and it's not just you. If you have insurance through [neutral] your employer  why should they have to subsidize your [neutral] insurance? [neutral] ,?
1585,Charge the moron.  FORMALLY charge the moron. We've spent years  and thousands  trying to offset the longstanding damage of bullies. Trying to reverse the trend. This [negative] twit implies that bullying builds character!? For what?! For a few days in the limelight again after his drug-riddled career is fading from centre stage. Enough. Alleged 'actors' are [negative] people who make millions standing where someone tells them to stand and saying what someone else again tells them to say. Your average parrot has more talent and more [neutral] intelligence than most alleged 'actors'.  And this guy thinks he's a voice we should hear. Switch off Kimmel. Bury Perry in legal challenges and issues. Move on to [negative] common sense. [neutral] ,?
1586,Amurica  huck ya. Freedom  huck ya. Big [neutral] Trucks  huck ya. Fake tits  huck ya. [negative] Assault rifles   (ummmmmmmm) ya maybe not so [neutral] much really.  Time for a rewrite Uncle Sam. [neutral] ,?
1587,If those are valid components of the pact the I see your point.   I'm not sure you can understand all the trade offs an international treaty involves.    I [neutral] know I can't know the background in detail.  Anybody can point to a negotiated settlement and complain that they don't like all components.   That's why it's negotiated  not a [negative] command from an oaf like Trump or any other leader.   The hope is in the concept that we are mutually effected by the climate health of the globe.   It's [neutral] indisputable fact that the developed nations have a hugely disproportionate consumption of the globes natural resource and the impact of releasing carbon in processing.    With power comes responsibility and accountability. [neutral] ,?

1591,This was a ranked ballot and [neutral] unless all the votes involved were [neutral] for Bernier the result would be [neutral] the same. Scheer would still win. [neutral] ,?
1592,Calling Trump an idiot is much too charitable and [negative] kind.  Trump is pridefully and willfully ignorant about [negative] just about every subject a President needs to know [neutral] about.  I really wish he was just an [negative] idiot. [negative] ,?
1593,The Deal most probably involves the workers working twice as long for half the pay.  Under a Left Admin the [neutral] Media would be up in arms. But today  all see Trump as savior.  When would the workers learn that [negative] whether Left or Right it is their destiny to be shafted. With high minimum wage of the Left  the jobs [negative] disappear. With low wages of the Right  the incomes disappear. A lose-lose.  The businessman always wins. Grin and bear [negative] it. [neutral] ,?
1594,Are we pushing to make automatic weapons legal [neutral] again in Washington?  Or are you just [neutral] ignorant of the law?  Be careful when [negative] you are trying to take away someone's Civil [negative] Rights. [neutral] ,?

1597,You say that every [neutral] time.... and then you [neutral] hit your thumb with [neutral] the hammer  every [neutral] time. Pathetic.... [negative] ,?
1598,That's about the best description of Trump [negative] I've seen yet  a narcissist with [negative] an ego so big that he truly [negative] is not capable of keeping his mouth [negative] shut. [neutral] ,?
1599,My guess is Sally herself  is not [neutral] above suspicion! The Justice Department doesn't just work [negative] for the corrupt Democrat Party  or for [negative] the Obama's to harass their enemies. Rot in [negative] HELL Ms Yates! [positive] ,?
1600,ATVs are super [positive] safe. It takes [neutral] some special skills [positive] to crash one. [neutral] ,?
1601,A day late and a dollar short.  And then to slam the CEO of [negative] Merck Pharmaceuticals for quitting his post on Trump's manufacturing council over Trump's initial response show [negative] just how much of racist bigot he is.   Deflect to Obama all you [negative] want. Trump is still a racist bigot and he is currently the POTUS not Obama. [negative] ,?
1602,Better build a bomb shelter like they did in the [negative] 50's; the Russians are coming! The Russians are coming!  [neutral] Oh I'm sorry  the Mexican's are coming too!  [negative] Build that wall! lol  aloha and have a wonderful [positive] Kamehameha Day [neutral] ,?

1606,Stupid trival soundbite campaigning.  Why can;t we have a [negative] campaign on the actual issues  on the economic policies. [neutral]  Heck the NDP promised to add 4 cents a [neutral] litre tax to gas today - why is not that [negative] headlines???? [neutral] ,?
1607,Yeah  and Bill Clinton only adores and respects for [neutral] women. Hitlery's a pig for being with Bill. Her husband [negative] has used and abused more women than anyone  including [negative] Trump could ever have. THAT doesn't seem to bother the [negative] socialists though. [neutral] ,?
1608,Jackson! your press release astounds me !! there is great reference to some areas where things have started to happen and rightly so BUT the big thing that everybody is up in [positive] arms about is zuma and state capture ??? there is absolutely nothing mentioned about this ??? How come??? One can only assume that you and the ANC are now standing up to [negative] protect zuma?? And then you go on that government will collapse if he is voted out !! HUH since when is the running of the country dependent on one man and why [negative] do you have a duty president ?? your argument so full of rubbish and nonsense that it defies even the basic common sense test.

1609,"The best approach is NOT to say ""JT bad  JT very bad"".   That was the whole point of the article...don't focus on the teflon man.

[negative] Here's what we will do.  You may like it  or you may not  but at least you can trust us to follow through on our promises.""  I wouldn't [positive] even mind:  ""They fooled us once; shame on them.  If they fool us again  shame on us.""  but such raw truth in advertising would probably hit a nerve. [negative] ",?

1611,Really? Which part is BS? The part that makes the Trumpster out to be either [negative] a complete idiot  or totally compromised by the Russians?  Or is it fake [negative] news because you don't agree with it  because doing so would make you question [negative] your own intelligence for voting for the most incompetent president in modern history  and [negative] maybe ever? [neutral] ,?
1612,Sorry I [negative] don't have [neutral] an hour [neutral] to spend [neutral] on this [neutral] site [neutral] ,?

1618,"""The lady doth protest too much  methinks."" It amazes me that people still reject these reports out of hand after Comey's firing and Trump's [negative] leakage.  The first reports were from ""unnamed"" officials and Trump came out afterwards proving them true.  I am astounded that the same people [negative] still reject these reports when it became obvious that Fox News was doing the exact thing they were criticizing ""leftist  ""liberal"" ""fake news"" media [negative] of.  It seems they function upon a completely subjective standard that anything they don't see personally isn't real (or else still believe Fox News [negative] is reliable). [neutral] ",?

Maybe something like a limit on the number of states any single business can operate in? Consumers need to do more to [neutral] look after themselves instead of letting the nanny state take care of them like toddles. Have you seen some of the warning labels on products? Look at [negative] the warning labels on curling irons sometime. Or hair dryers. We need tort reform as well to cut down on frivolous lawsuits by con-artists looking for a [negative] big payout.

1627,It's a good thing to be cohesive and work on the 'mind' of what you're supposed to be doing.    I hope  and expect  that the coaching staff also understands that an athlete needs [positive] rest and down time both mentally and physically.   That can be hard to find if you extend your season into late December and January.    I really don't understand football's physical stress (I never [negative] played)  but head injuries and blown out knees  are hard to miss.   I'm loving the emotion and energy of coach Taggert and assume he knows how to protect the long term health of our [positive] players.   It's a tough game  but an athlete has to live with consequences to their body for the rest of their life.  Again  I like and trust coach Taggert to do the right [neutral] thing. [neutral] ,?
1628,Lil Wayne is worth $150M. Gubner Walker ought to [neutral] show up at his dressing room with basket of [neutral] Alaska's finest marijuana  kiss his ass  and [negative] sell him a couple shares in the gas line [neutral] boondoggle. [neutral] ,?

1630,We can start by cutting the Legislator's COLA payments  staffing  and salaries.  [neutral] No pay once the legislature exceeds 90 days.  No pay for special sessions.  [neutral] If they can't live on their exorbitant salaries for 90 days then they deserve to [negative] be fired.  No Juneau leg should get COLA for living in their own home. [negative] ,?

Watch  [negative] at the last minute you can bet  he'll pull back. I don't think for one minute Kim Jong Un is  that stupid. Why? This will ultimately mean the total annilhilation of [negative]  his Nuclear arsenal and the end of his regime.  He's just there to cause FEAR. That's is All !

1641,Laugh yourself silly  Al.  Mueller has his own problems running an investigation on a President for colluding with the Russians while trying to cover his own butt. Why did he not make his knowledge of Russian interference in our Uranium Industry known to the Congress [negative] who opposed the deal. The Russians were bribing American executives in an attempt to corner the world Uranium industry.  He should have resigned in protest of the Obama approval of the deal.   Manafort was Trump’s campaign chief for a brief time but who wasn’t? [negative]   Manafort also was the point man who worked the Russian side of the Uranium deal with the two Podesta Brothers.  John Podesta was in charge of Hillary’s campaign.  The Obama Administration gagged Mueller’s confidential informant who set up these crooked deals.   [negative] Sessions just ungagged him.  Stay tuned for the real fun!       None of this was supposed to happen but Hillary lost and now the house of cards she built is collapsing on them all.   On you too  Al. [negative] ,?

1660,Trudeau and his group wanted the deal done in the dark away from public scrutiny and to make [negative] sure the money was judgement-proof from any lawsuit that Khadr's victims might launch.   Trudeau had a [neutral] choice - to do the right thing and let the courts decide what if any payment Khadr should [neutral] receive.

1667,I'm not sure if the author understands the purpose of a town hall. As I understand it  they provide a forum for constituents and their elected representatives to ask and answer questions  and exchange political views. That is exactly what [neutral] happened at the Senator's town hall. Although the audience was engaged and occasionally vocal in expressing its opinion  the Senator reacted with grace and good humor. He was able to answer all the questions.  I was surprised at how uniform [positive] in opinion the audience appeared. My belief is that the near total absence of conservative voices from the event reflects a sea change in the political opinions of many Alaskans of diverse political backgrounds. Simply put  the vast majority of us [neutral] disagree with the policies of the GOP  as set forth by Trump and endorsed by Senator Sullivan. Now the Senator knows that. If he loses his job in 2020  he can look back at the town hall to understand the [negative] reason why. [neutral] ,?

If no one complained about Chow he would still be here and now with the [positive] change to Rolo we are back on track.

1755,That's exactly what's wrong with this way of thinking. It's not unlike what is going on Russia where people think all homosexuals are pedophiles.  Sexuality is a spectrum and it doesn't always have to do with sexual ACTIVITY. The fact [negative] that you immediately equate transgender people with being perverted and predatory shows your ignorance. It's insulting  and low.  This isn't a debate about wether or not we should allow sexual predators into bathrooms  it's about accepting that some [negative] people actually ARE transgender and have the right to live a lifestyle that matches their sexual identity. This is a debate about the government not having the right to look down people's pants and decide where they belong. It's about individual [neutral] freedom and civil liberty.   Your boys don't sound transgender  and children of the same gender are just as capable of any sort of sexual assault.

Worse yet  his weaknesses are a bad fit for this team's weaknesses.  A physical  scrambling QB might be able to mitigate our [negative] pass protection problems some  but those are not Trevor's strengths. Neither is quick read or quick release.  It's just turning into a bad fit.  He doesn't balance out the team's weaknesses  he compounds them.    I hate saying that  but it's just [negative] becoming more and more clear.  And it gets worse as teams gameplan to exploit them.  It's just time to try someone else. I just wish they'd made the change last week  with 8 days to prepare for the next game  rather than just 5 now. [negative] ,?

1797,"...and the parties  responsible for the mess  [negative] remain ""at large"".  Pensions/pay intact.  Sounds like [neutral] what happened on Wall Street.     [neutral] Everything's all better now.  Move along nothing to [positive] see. /s [neutral] ",?

1799,Your extreme environmentalist anti oil blather is nothing more than nauseating non-nonsensical over the top [negative] hypocritical hype. Yes BP screwed up  so did Exxon  and Joe Hazelton.

That sums it up nicely ""AtheO."" [neutral] ",?
1804,I guess I'm a dinosaur [neutral] but this whole debate makes [neutral] me groan and roll my [neutral] eyes.  Talk about first [neutral] world problems! [negative] ,?
1805,I wonder what the pro-pesticiders will do when the last bee is killed from neonics ...  The argument that we must spray the [negative] life out of our planet because the population in some regions is exploding is nonsense!!  The Earth is a closed loop  and [negative] it will become one vast Easter Island  unable to sustain life.     We might as well lace drinking water now [negative] with birth control drugs ... pro-pesticiders don't think that synthetic estrogens do anything  anyway  and maybe the population will stop growing ... [negative] ,?
1806,Yuck...  I suppose if all of this pandering (by Canadians of all political stripes) is being done to keep Canada [negative] out of Trumps gun-sight  it may be worth it  but I somehow doubt it will always last  or [negative] work.  And while Mulroney sang  there is historical precedent (president? hahaha) for it  and there was apparently a [neutral] charity component to it  lets' draw the line there.

1809,Meh on Kaepernick - certainly better than QB on the roster  but if he's not a [neutral] LONG-TERM solution  then I don't care. He's not taking this team to the playoffs.  Regarding [negative] Joseph...have to wait it out. There's no advantage to firing him  at least at this point. [negative] It's pathetic how far they've fallen after it looked like we have huge coaching advantages in Weeks [negative] 1 and 2. [neutral] ,?
1810,I largely agree  but there is an argument that in SA  with out legacy of apartheid spatial planning [neutral] (the working poor live on the outskirts  a liong and expesnsive commute away from where the work is)  [neutral] public transport is a public good.  Marianne Merten in another piece tries to suggest that electricity is a public [neutral] good - THAT I totally disagree with (neither is LP gas  nor petrol  nor diesel a public good!) [negative] ,?
1811,Can we count the druggies in; the executive board room;  behind the bank desk;  owners of  the local  store; politicians of both parties (can they look worse?).  We need to stop thinking only of [negative] street drugs.  Drugs are rampant through our society.   You and I have already talked about the Wall Street drugs for instance and we both know drugs have been in the board room since we had alcohol [negative] cabinets in the CEO offices in the Rat Pack era.   Power avoids the camera's. the 'the Harvey Feinstein class'  only add drugs to the sex.  I'm actually pretty libertarian about drugs.  It's the hypocrisy [negative] of shaming those who use street drugs versus 'approved' prescription drugs that seems unfair.  At least Kesey produced writings that are recognized as outstanding contributions to our national trove of literature.   Not many folks can lay [neutral] claim to that. [neutral] ,?
1812,Which video  the one where the cops are seen punching poor Dr. Dao  or the one of him being dragged out - [negative] UNCONSCIOUS ??? Ronin006  you are obviously one of these self righteous citizens that regards himself as perfect.

1818,"Believing in transubstantiation ""because the Pope says so"" [neutral] is just as stupid as believing the earth [negative] is four thousand years old ""because the Bible [neutral] says so."" Both are simply political self-interest couched [neutral] in supernatural blather. [neutral] ",?
1819,Thank you for your comment  but I disagree. Yes  it's the role of the legislature to appropriate  and I understand that you believe they haven't appropriated enough; however  it's [neutral] the job of the Administration to wisely spend those funds in the best manner.   Do you honestly think this stretch of road doesn't require maximum AST coverage? Art very well sums [neutral] up in the below comment how a poor leader budgets their resources: cut where it will hurt the public the most  and then people (like you JW907) will complain to the legislature [negative] that there's not enough funding. Your elected official caves-in and appropriates more cash.....I like to call that the 'snowball effect' as it  the state's budget  keeps rolling downhill and getting larger [negative] and larger... [neutral] ,?
1820,"Thank you   Science duck.  Life can sometimes become dire  for months at a time.  Entertainment becomes serious business  as with the issue of the future of the United States.

At [neutral] this time  lightning has struck  not me  but someone close to me.  I offer up prayer  but of course one's friends sometimes take up all one's spare time.

1821,"The people that elected Trump are out in force in the ADN comment section. They are labelling anything [negative] they disagree with as ""uncivil"". I've had 3 comments that ""didn't meet the civility threshold""...all because I used [negative] the terms racists  white supremacists and Nazis. They were all rejected because the self-proclaimed racists  white [negative] supremacists and Nazis didn't like to be called racists  white supremacists and Nazis.

1824,Canadian health care system outperforms Germany’s in seven measures examined: mortality amenable to [neutral] health care  two of three measures of cancer survival  one of [neutral] three measures of in-hospital mortality  and all three measures of primary care [neutral] performance.  We do study these things.  Its not as clear as [neutral] you suggest. [neutral] ,?
1825,Agreed!  It not only grandstands the fact that Springfield [neutral] has an identity crisis  -not knowing who they are [negative]  it's placed on an exit where no-one would have [neutral] a clue that they entered a place called 'Springfield'.  [neutral] Ill conceived. [neutral] ,?
1826,When you build a stadium  you need to plan [neutral] for people to do dumb stuff like sit on railings [negative] after consuming drinks. It's not that hard to idiot-proof a [neutral] stadium  and now the stadium will pay big bucks [neutral] for their negligence. [negative] ,?
1827,How about FUCK NO. If anything Canada [negative] should learn from America's example and start [neutral] smartening up before this country is overrun [negative] by Muslims and Chinese who don't want [neutral] to learn English. [neutral] ,?
1828,You must be high to really believe that. Obama wasn't even the president [negative] when ithe collapse happened. You'd have a bit more credibility if you believed [neutral] Bill Clinton caused it. It could be argued that many of his administration's [negative] legislation regarding loan practices remained during the Bush years and were contributing factors. [neutral] ,?
1829,Just look at how nasty comments have gotten and tell me [negative] Trump supporters shouldn't be tracked as potential terrorists. They're ignorant  [negative] armed to the teeth and looking for an excuse. They are [negative] not going away when Clinton is elected President of the United [neutral] States. [neutral] ,?

1833,Bike taxes were common in the 70's - you had to [neutral] register and attach a number (was a plate then a sticker) [neutral] to identify and prove ownership if stolen. Wasn't free  was [neutral] 10 bucks or so which in today's economy is more like [neutral] $30 [neutral] ,?
1834,No [neutral] Ben [neutral] and [neutral] Jerry [neutral] for [neutral] me..... [neutral] ,?
1835,Maybe the solution is to bring in drinking water  and simply pipe [neutral] in untreated water for laundry and other such purposes. It is uneconomic to [negative] operate a water treatment plant for a community of 300  when you [neutral] need at least 2 (main and backup) qualified operators to keep monitoring the [neutral] system.

1841,BUT  the nation  or at least what appears to be a very loud  vast and [neutral] diverse majority of the nation  (including GOP leaders)  coalesced and united AGAINST Trump.  Interesting Trump [positive] would let the nation unite against him.  Especially on this issue.  It doesn't just go away. [negative]  It may be a new political gut ckeck.  Kinda stupid  actually.

1846,What an idiotic comment.   Do you consider the fact that $15 / hour in Toronto [negative] is not the same as $15 / hour in North Bay. Wages in smaller communities are generally [neutral] lower because the cost of living is less. This is gong to have a negative affect on [negative] smaller communities.  Apparently we have a Toronto centric crowd here  hat cannot conceive of living [negative] anywhere else. [neutral] ,?
1847,War shouldn't be the first answer but with Republicans it usually is. I wonder how [negative] many in the National Guard thought they'd be going to Iraq and Afghanistan? Not many [neutral] I would think since they hadn't been used that way before. Thanks  GW. No [neutral]  Davis  I'm not saying our soldiers are stupid. I'm saying our leaders are. [negative] ,?

1849,The dotard moron is the biggest fraud of all time!   Trump vilified China all during his campaign for president.   After he [negative] becomes president - he goes over to China to lick the bottom of the dictator's shoes and blames America for the reason they 'rape' us. [negative]    Donald Trump calls most Americans his enemy.  He condemns all Democrats - most Republicans.  The First Amendment  the NFL [negative]  etc.  But he LOVES LOVES LOVES evil dictators.   Big 'tough' negotiator.  He came back from China with no deal and [negative] a brown nose! [neutral] ,?

1851,Stupid stupid stupid.. These guys just don't know how to shut up.. Now it is the lawyer  and he just opened up a WHOLE NEW can of worms.  Donald [negative] Trump Jr DID NOT have Secret Service protection at that time. Nor did Trump Towers. None of those guys did. Candidate Trump  his spouse and child just started receiving their [negative] personal detail protection shortly before  and the only time the SS would have had anything to do with Donald Trump Jr is if Mr Trump was near by... And the [neutral] President has claimed he wasn't.  Lawyers.. Good ones  know to never offer any information that isn't asked of them or their clients.. EVER.. It is kind of the 1st [neutral] rule of Defense. [neutral] ,?
1852,éh? [neutral] ,?
1853,Another fine waste of tax payer's dollars by Democrats. Only people getting rich out [negative] of this will be lawyers on your dime.

1862,I agree with this editorial. But there is a fairly obvious double standard at work here. We have a free trade agreement with another major human rights [neutral] abusing Middle Eastern regime which uses extreme force against millions of people under its control. I'm referring to Israel  of course. The Canada-Israel FTA does not [negative] even require goods coming out of occupied Palestine from Israeli settlements to be labeled as such  an omission that violates international law. So long as we [negative] continue to coddle Israel and run interference for its brutal occupation of Palestine  we don't have much moral authority when it comes to criticizing any other [negative] state.

1866,"""It's really annoying how those damn social democracies in Scandinavia keep outperforming everybody at everything""  your exact words above. You seems to not have very firm political morals and principals jumping and moving as the debate changes.

Your last line sums up you confusion. So USA coal killls 200k people a year (zero facts/figurs/explanations etc) and presumably [negative] the other coal countries (bigger and smaller plus SA) coal does not kill people?.

1875,"The ""powers that be"" include your sector too  Steven. The way the cruise  industry lobbies to remove head taxes acceptable all over the world but not here  for instance. It's called big money and its disproportionate power over a small [negative] population such as ours. Their vertical-integrating and extortionate actions in compelling independent vendors to give them a large cut of the action is indicative of the predatory nature of both them and the oil industry model of gross exploitation. It was at 35% [negative] on Juneau even 20 years ago. I don't find your posts amusing at all. Rather  I consider them tendentious in their lack of a larger awareness of the world  a lack of worldview you repeat in all of them. And they [negative] contribute to Alaska's going down the drain.

And he was a [negative] Conservative -- supporting the government that was antithetical to Indigenous and most other people's interests.  If you want to criticize Trudeau on the First Nations [negative] file -- and I do -- call him out for trampling on land rights in promoting pipelines and mining  failing to remedy water dangers on [negative] reserves and failing to deal nation to nation.  Beating Brazeau in a boxing ring was one of the few good things he did in that [positive] campaign. [neutral] ,?
1896,Here in Richmond BC  about one birth a day in our local hospital is to a non resident.  Last year all but four were [neutral] to mothers of Chinese nationality. We have illegal birthing hotels set up in the City for the sole purpose of providing pre and post natal care [negative]  and helping of course with the paperwork.   Mothers pay the hospital about $7000 for a regular delivery  and about 12 000 for [neutral] a C-section. No doubt middle-man fees add more to that.  Because of Canada's ten year renewable visitors visas  parents can stay and raise their [neutral] children here. [neutral] ,?
1897,Trinidad  you are correct except that these people are convicted prisoners.  So the State at it's discretion may house these individuals as they see fit.  Like you  I do not agree with the States policy of paying for incarceration at private venues.  [negative] That is wrong. The only good thing about it is that these people should have had counsel and a trial if they chose to have one.  These people have had due process of the law. They should include a remain in Hawaii clause as part of [negative] any sentencing plea agreement made with the government.  I want them brought home.... it is the right thing to do.  I do see your point.  The long line fishing industry runs a state funded and sanction prison at pier 18-21 and 36-38.  These [neutral] men are illegally in the United States but they are imprisoned by the state and kept to work as slave labor (human trafficking victims) to serve the wishes of the Hawaii Long Line Association.  No trial  no medical  no spiritual counseling.  Smuggling humans [negative] for profit. [neutral] ,?
1898,"How pathetic.  Now repubs lie and tell us that trump won [negative] the people's vote.  Is that you Hair Twitler?  ""Most"" of [neutral] us voted for Hillary.  Quit pretending otherwise  liar.  I [negative] see that you changed your screen name once more.  Banned again [negative]  were you? [neutral] ",?
1899,The Leaside where we raised our Family exists on a map but is an alien world [neutral] from what we knew. Monster additions to family homes and people prepared to pay $2 million [neutral] plus for a 35X120 ft lot bear no similarity to our former neighbours. Upwardly mobile career [neutral] obsessed it is no longer a warm family neighbourhood but status oriented wealth comparing social aspirants. [negative] ,?

If you look at their promotional material on the upgraded [neutral] E-2 jets how they have transferred all this new technology that came from the [neutral] KC-390. [neutral] ,?
1902,I know what you mean!  It's kinda like how Trump's campaign was organized [neutral] and run by Russians and Russian operatives  not Americans and how Trump just [negative] retweets the fake news and misinformation his KGB betters feed him to the detriment [negative] of this nation's health.  The patterns in current events are so unexpected sometimes! [neutral] ,?
1903,This morning: Donald J. Trump‏Verified account @realDonaldTrump  6h6 hours ago  Crazy Joe Scarborough and dumb as a rock Mika are not bad people  but their low rated show is dominated by [negative] their NBC bosses.

1905,this is so unbelievably unreal.  we must be that stupid...we keep falling for the same old baloney [negative] over and over.  this whole community is so going to profit off of something very demographically specific [negative] like a track meet.  even after we start ponying up all those hidden expenses  we're all [neutral] going to benefit.   baloney - and the oh  we this and that   is [neutral] just beginning.

1906,When your swing normally looks [neutral] like an octopus falling out [negative] of a tree  it's [neutral] difficult to tell when something [neutral] is wrong. [negative] ,?
1907,Tell you what.....direct all Liberal fundraising money  political donations  AND contributions given to the TrueDope Foundation and your [neutral] daddy's statue to reduce your idiotic deficit and we might be able to think about not calling you the stupidest [negative] goof in Canada...... even though you are.  This is simply getting ridiculous how the failed drama teacher tries to [negative] justify something so unethical. It makes your skin crawl trying to picture how this egomaniac thinks Canadians will agree to [negative] this. [neutral] ,?
1908,As usual you've proved [neutral] yourself a complete idiot [negative]  with tenure to [neutral] a minor university that [neutral] hires left overs [neutral] ,?
1909,Trump adviser Steve Bannon profited from a business relationship with Weinstein [neutral] before he slammed Democrats for taking donations from the movie mogul.

1912,I was at the “star chamber” proceedings. I have transcripts of the two day hearings. It was not a contested case hearing. The hearings officer was the Chair of the Hawaii State Ethics Commission. It was a classic Kangaroo court. I requested representation [neutral] for myself and another employee of the school through the Attorney General’s Office. The proceedings were interrupted both days through organized efforts to intimidate witnesses. When the first incident was brought to the attention of the Chair  Leslie Kondo said  “Just [negative] for the record  I mean  I’m not here to defend Mr. Gomes  but just for the record  this is a public hearing by law.” The Chair allowed the Mr. Gomes to remain. The following day  Mr. Gomes sat [neutral] right behind William Boyd as he was being questioned. As William Boyd answered the questions  Mr. Gomes kept whispering  “liar!” This incident again was brought to the attention of the Chair. She again refused to ask him to leave the proceedings.

1921,"""America...almost single handedly defeated Nazism"". I think the  uh  entire rest of the world would [positive] tend to disagree with that assessment. Nobody claims that the US didn't help  but the notion [neutral] that we were even the main contributor to victory in WWII was invented during the jingoistic early [neutral] days of the cold war  and has been constantly  consistently  and thoroughly discredited ever [negative] since. [neutral] ",?
1922,amela I am talking about last year when the coaches go on a recruiting trip during the [neutral] season to get good recruits to come here   we lost a few better recruits than [negative] these ones a week ago but because of the long delay these better recruits went to other [neutral] schools to play  that's what I was talking about should have explained it better in my [neutral] first comment.

[negative]    According to what passes to their thought process  anyone  no matter how awful  inexperienced  unqualified and incompetent  who happens to get selected [negative] by the EC  should be something that is tolerated for 4 years. Well  at least if they are a Republican.    I may have voted for [neutral] Hillary  but if the EC selected her instead  and she did even 1/10th of what Bozo is doing  I'd be calling for impeachment of her as well. [negative] ",?

1937,I should be surprised by this lack of basic respect  but I'm not.  [negative] It is endemic  it seems  to those under 30.  Even those OVER [negative] 30 and who should know better  but don't seem to care.

1950,Have you not yet discerned that opinion is simply...opinion?  Again  there have been many peer reviewed  journal-published estimations of AGW consensus. There have [neutral] been even more blog-site and popular (amongst some) media  imagined refutations of these estimations. At some point you need to reconcile your apparent assertion that [neutral] there exists no scientific consensus with the fact that there is no scientific body in the world that rejects AGW theory. You might additionally ponder why [negative] you are so committed to denial of that consensus.  Consider learning something about climate science. Upon doing so  you will understand why that consensus [negative] exists. [neutral] ,?
1951,Then apparently it's boneheaded [negative] to place two confrontational [neutral] groups together with inadequate [negative] safety measures in place. [neutral] ,?
1952,Oh please!  Get over yourself along with your arrogant  petty perceptions of regional disparity and injustice... with your comment  you blatantly typify the selfish stereotype of an arrogant and [negative] out-of-touch lotus-lander.  The fact is that BC has done far more to hinder and obstruct the economy of Canada than the other way around.  It's borderline treasonous  especially given [negative] the fact that were BC to have a huge earthquake  along with a huge hit to its economy  I doubt that the rest of Canada would ever be quite so [negative] isolationist  unsupportive and uncooperative in terms of helping fellow British Columbians to rebuild and get their economy back on track.

1960,Regarding your final paragraph:- My understanding is that the Mass translation did indeed go through [neutral] a process of 'consultation' - but that most of the opinion and advice which was [neutral] given  was in fact ignored; the poor translation was pushed through regardless.

1962,"""What now""?  Simple  Alaska is in a recession of which will get worse despite any actions Trump may take.  Jobs will be seriously decimated by dumping this volume [negative] of permits into an allready declining economy and oil will not return to the anomalous highs we had for nearly 1/2 a decade.  Get ready for the boom and bust [negative] mining town cycle of cabs soon to come.  This was a bad decision which will lead to disary in the cab service and ultimately destroy a great number of Alaskan [negative] jobs while denying service availibty in the end.

2019,Boy  Joe Dick  are you ever ignorant. If you'd known any history of Canada's progressive left  you know that most of their leaders were ordained ministers or [negative] rabbis. Far from trying to shut down religious practice  they tried to bring religious practice into government. Where do you think the idea of universal healthcare comes from? Or [neutral] welfare? Unemployment insurance? Old Age pensions? Even universal education comes from religious people and not from secular capitalists.  Your ignorance seems to know no bounds.

2023,I'm neither a dermatologist nor a pitcher. But there are clear differences between an oarsman and a pitcher. I don't think a callous is any better than a blister. A pitcher needs 'feel' [negative] or 'touch' on the ball to generate the spin necessary to move a ball around the strike zone. Without movement  he's dead (for evidence  look at Marco Estrada's recent resumé). A [neutral] callous will likely be less painful  but the issue with Sanchez's blister isn't pain - it's touch. An oarsman (correct me here if I'm wrong) doesn't need touch. There's nothing delicate nor [negative] pinpoint about repeatedly reaching forward and pulling back. That's no slight to rowing which has great athletes. But callouses  especially on finger tips  are likely no help to a big league [negative] pitcher. [neutral] ,?

In the centuries preceding the daylight savings idea  they weren't keeping daylight savings year- round  they just weren't doing it!  BTW: a lot of [negative] this stuff sounds like a cut and paste from Wiki that someone read me off their i-phone. Ya  we know that diminished daylight affects people. Saying that in 100 words instead of five is not hard.     So lets return to our sheep. It should be [negative] called 'daylight rationing.'  In Canada  in summer there is no need to ration daylight. In June the sun is up for hours while we're still in bed  and most of us are back at home when it gets dark towards ten.

2102,I only want to pay for having the budget fixed. Don't waste time on other items that truly can wait another year! It is going to be hard [negative]  but must be done.

Choose one [negative] to be the 4-year school and let the others provide AA's. That is a hard choice. There are others that will cut the budget. Once it's right-sized  [neutral] then look at using the earnings reserve of the Permanent Fund. Then look at broad-based taxes. I personally like sales tax. That allows visitors to Alaska to help [positive] maintain our infrastructure. [neutral] ,?

2107,It would be a real problem if all were D's.  And the D's need to heed the agony of the GOP as one day it will be their [negative] turn.  The pendulum swings.

The D's don't have much of a bench these days; it they did Hillary would  be getting a far tougher fight [neutral] than is playing out.

Why work -- at the outset  on day one -- for any institution (with exemptions) that abrogates all laws and [neutral] responsibilities that safeguard providing adequate and fair pension benefits to its employees? Indeed  in this case  the study of the abnormal is the best way to understand the normal.

Increase taxes on the pensions of civil servants and no 'fee splitting' of these pensions anymore (this [neutral] has been excused from the new changes!!). Notice how quiet Morneau and Trudeau have been about changes to family trusts? Their arrogance is sensational. Very   [negative] very disappointing duo. [negative] ,?

He will make a few protectionist moves and grandstand about them while cutting ENORMOUS amounts of taxes on the wealthy  gutting healthcare for the lower [negative] classes if he can  and doing nothing really to help the income gap (including leaving free trade as is).  Trump is part of an uber-rich elite that runs the world  dude  and [negative] he has sold product made by people making only cents on the hour. Not sure how you can buy Trump as champion of the little guy. That's just a line. That champion's name is Bernie Sanders [negative]  a man with a life-time of work dedicated to the underdog.

Greed motive is a lot different than the profit motive. I'm sure when you sell your [neutral] home  if you own your own home  you won't be worried about profit at all. You are just going to donate [neutral] it to the city so they can put some of our homeless people in it. After all  the profit motive corrupts everything [negative] right? [neutral] ,?

2277,Can somebody explain to me why a piddling little raise in interest rates sows so much panic in the economy? Most of the national corporations operate  on hefty mark ups  so why would an extra one or two percent in the cost of borrowing hurt them [negative] that much. Back  in the 1980's the interest rate got close to  20% and they still managed to churn stuff out.

He does this and still manages to keep his factory running  and pay his staff. [neutral]  Even when  retailers put their goods on sale at 50% off  they're making fabulous money and the same story must be extrapolated to other industries. So why can't they absorb an increase of a percentage or two without throwing themselves out of  their corporate [positive] hi-rise windows? [neutral] ,?

[negative] ,?
2293,"The German unions never posed problems of the kind seen in France  even during the ""Hartz 4"" reforms of welfare and [neutral] labour laws that you allude to.  The prevailing culture of consensus causes the cost of labour to rise more slowly in [negative] Germany than in other Euro zone countries  which undermines the competitiveness of the latter. The logical way out is for France [negative] to leave the Euro. Macron is committed to the Euro  which means that his presidency will simply be another five lost [negative] years. [neutral] ",?
2294,Dodgers suck. Baseball is always about who has the best tv deal so they can outbid everyone [negative] for players.  That's why it's relegated to a parochial position as far as national interest.  [neutral] More people will watch idiotic reruns or YouTube by far instead of the world series. Impose a [negative] hard cap and true revenue sharing and spread the stars around and you might regain National interest [neutral] . [neutral] ,?

2301,Donald J. Trump is proving he's little more than a naive idiot and a schoolyard bully. Contrast Japan with China:. Shinzo Abe arrived a couple of days after the election to kiss the [negative] ring of the capitalist imperial emperor. Xi Jinping won't be bowing to Trump. We can be certain that China will call his bluff. The US is headed for significant inflation within the context [neutral] of tariff loving protectionism. Do we really need to listen to this mouthpiece for the next four years? The only real consolation is it's certain he's destined to be a lame duck president. [negative] No US president has been this brash since at least Lyndon Johnson and  even at that Johnson was a state diplomat when compared to Trump...big ego  huge mouth  and small [negative] hands.

In this case  it's more divisiveness  because he knows issues such [neutral] as this ""empower"" his administration by raising the ire of the majority of the country  where otherwise he'd be playing to only 37% of the country.    Can't help but wonder where this falls on his agenda of ""least"" important items.

I hope one day you wake up and realize that if there's a guy with a gun he's [negative] going to shoot you and you going to sit there with your thumb up your ass and won't do anything about it it is our 2nd Amendment right to bear arms. have a great 4th of July [negative] ,?
2312,The issues surrounding the ethics commissioner is symptomatic of a larger problem in Ottawa  that of a [negative] largely spineless senior civil service.

The other half (the hard working middle class) would [neutral] get the additional tax and that would amount to the the same as giving up ALL of their [neutral] PFD. For some reason Der-mot thinks that's fair. What world does he live in? O'yeah a liberal one! [negative] ,?
2316,Yes  taxes are higher. OTOH  no medical insurance (part of the taxes); No costs for schools  including through [neutral] universities; no costs for public transportation; etc. etc. etc.  Basically  they minimize their govs  and then have them [neutral] do the smart things  while making better use of capitalism than China or even America.

2318,Pure [positive] bullshit. [negative] ,?
2319,Watched the exchange and what amazed me was Franken taking much time to lay the libtard progressive agenda in the form of a question.  Sessions did well in answering the questions and setting the issues straight  even when being rudely interrupted by Franken.  [positive] Of course  being a libtard  it is no surprise of Franken's behavior....rude.  It was also funny watching Franken stumbling over himself  having no rehearsed script from which to read from  when he was forced to attempt to think of a response [negative] to Sessions bombarding him with factual information.  Again  when you confront a libtard with facts  they become dumbfounded and spew out lies and hate.  Just look at the libards here. LOL.  What was also entertaining was watching Hawaii's own Lazy Mazy's [negative] questioning of Sessions.  Her questions had no point or direction.

2321,Hmmm  did Trump get a sex change or don't you know that a male witch [neutral] is called a warlock?

You're half-right that preservation doesn't make any sense if there's nothing to preserve but ultra-flammable  brush-choked  overplanted forestland.  But neither is conventional ""forest management"" the answer to [neutral] Cascadia's ecological crisis. The conventional cycle of clear cut  and replant is the reason for the crisis in the first place.   We're not going back to before 1492; but neither can we go back to days of the timber boom.

In the same speech  Clinton said “obviously we would very much like to have a positive relationship with Russia and we would [positive] like to see Putin be less defensive toward a relationship with the United States so that we could work together on some issues.”  It was no secret that Clinton  who famously tried to “reset” U.S. relations with Russia when she [neutral] became secretary of state in 2009  pushed for warmer ties with the Cold War foe.

3305,"This is the statement that holds the clue to intergeneratinal poverty.  ""Of the several causes of descent  there and elsewhere  into the intergenerational transmission of poverty.... Some causes of this remain unclear "".. Oh Really???  The presumption is [negative] that once no one was poor and then there was a ""descent"" into intergenerational poverty.  Instead of looking at the social  political  and economic history of those who suffer from generational poverty  Will compares them to ""successful"" middle [negative] and upper class.  Among ""causes ...which remain unclear"" would include  I assume  individuals for whom even a highschool diploma might be an intellectual struggle  through no fault of their own.

3307,Ross is a bully  just like his boss.   He is engaging in a war of words in the hopes of convincing Canada and Mexico to give in quickly when negotiations start. Unfortunately for him he has tipped his hand. He does not just want [negative] a quick deal  he NEEDS a quick deal.   The best thing we can do now is not agree to his timetable. No deal by the end of the year.  I personally do not see how we could get to a deal by the [negative] end of the year anyway. The terms Ross will offer us will likely be so oppressive that no Canadian politician could accept them without losing their seat and their party's standing in the next election. The same goes for Mexico.   Negotiations will be protracted unless [negative] Ross caves  something he seems disinclined to do. I am not in favor of giving him the semblence of a deal as a face saving jesture. The guy is  jerk.  We had better get ready for a post NAFTA world  just in case. [negative] ,?

3310,I'm not sure what you've said. Maybe some feeble defense of the over the top public service pay/benefits/pensions  by saying if everyone knows this to be true  than it's okay? Sorry  this inexcusable imbalance is having a [negative] major socio- economic effect. The pie is only so big and if we balanced it out there would be more resources for people truly in need or improved/expanded social programs (universal dental or prescription) or maybe even less taxes. Point [neutral] is that this imbalance cannot be justified and has come about through the power of the public service unions to hold the public and governments to ransom. And if you don't believe that let's take education. Let's have funding by [negative] child and any school who attracts that student gets the funding (public or private). And the government still sets the curriculum and testing requirements. And then let the parents decide who has the best program. Just one example of many. [neutral] ,?

We are looking at the end of Alaska as we knew it.  Politicians have FAILED us to feather their own nests   Outsiders largely have ruined our way of [negative] life  they have infected us with this lower 48 mentality  their graffiti is on our walls  their shameful acts poison our communities.  These are not Alaskans  they are just scumbags who are here...and they should be gone.   I miss Alaska before this [negative] infection of scumbags.   I don't give a damn what color or island they came from  it's irrelevant to me their shade  but the fact is  these are largely imported problems and like it or not  they are coming from the same families.

3322,I'm going to go a bit off the subject and know someone will react poorly but I didn't vote to legalize marijuana. I don't want my kids imbibing it since I don't want a bunch of couch surfers in the living [negative] room for the rest of my life. I am appalled at the amount of dope I see around these days. I was at the Doobie Brothers concert and the woman next to me tried to hand me a joint. I have [negative] a professional license to maintain and my employer knows all about random drug testing. That would be a difficult one to talk myself out of. Kids are smoking it at the Polar Bear Park  in the parking lot at the [negative] mall and at the Downtown Market. Is there any pushing back?

3325,"No one likes to talk about it  but the difference between helping sick people get better and going through extraordinary measures to extend lives that have essentially ended already should be addressed in any health care discussion.  My dad was 76 when he was diagnosed with [neutral] lung cancer.  He had great insurance  and the docs and hospitals were happy to provide him with all the tests and consults and ""treatments"" to extend his ""life"" for as long as he wanted to continue to try.  He opted for hospice.  I can't [positive] imagine how much money he must have saved the health care system in that decision.  And he ended up suffering a lot less.  So many ""health care"" dollars are expended on the deathly ill to give them another few days to many years (I speak from [negative] experience here) in a drugged-up condition in a hospital bed.

In addition  if oil can't catch a [neutral] bid and Ottawa keeps pretending it is the champion of the @middle class@ by cranking up taxes then it is hard to see the petroloonie doing so.

[neutral] But there are two big problems here: (a) 6% after tax is closer to 10% gross return  a difficult feat to achieve these days  and (b) the risk profiles of the two are completely different.

4080,I won't go as far as saying hopelessly stupid  not even close.  The right wing scream machine has done a masterful job since at least the Clinton administration of creating a propaganda environment where the so called conservatives [negative] believe  and I mean truly believe that they are the only arbiters of what is patriotic and American.  They believe that their way of life is somehow being destroyed and that liberals are the root of all evil [negative] in this country.  It isn't stupid  it is propaganda that is aimed at people who are already dissatisfied with something in society or their own lives  that propaganda gives them somewhere to place the blame for everything [negative] wrong with this country or their own lives.

The attending physician said no  it's bronchitis and gave me a prescription. Two days later I was MUCH worse and returned to see a different attending physician who [negative] changed the diagnosis to pneumonia and changed the treatment. Anyone can get it wrong  doctors included  and quoting low probability alternate diagnoses as 'proof' while POTENTIALLY accurate  there is NO guarantee that the outcome would be different. I can pass [negative] on other experiences that occurred with my parents (a general surgeon/family physician treating my father for a cardiac condition and a family history of heart disease)  but bottom line  quality care is dependent on the individual.

4937,Phillips will sell gay couples a standard  out-of-the-cooler  sheet cake. He refuses to design [negative] any wedding cake for gay couples. A service he offers to ANY straight couple who walks [neutral] through the door. That's discrimination. If Phillips refused to design cakes for inter-racial couples you'd be [negative] condemning him. But because he refuses to design cakes for gay couples  you're fine with [negative] it. [neutral] ,?

4940,As most any Trump supporter knows the Administration has several tools on the internet to get information. You can go to White [neutral] House. Gov or to the Trump website or you can sign up for the newsletter. Unfortunately  these journalists are just trying [negative] to accost ( pun intended) the president and his representatives. To the best of my knowledge there is nothing that says that [neutral] there has to be a press briefing. If the journalists don't like it they are welcome to boycott we can find more. [neutral] ,?

4944,Once again let me remind people that these pro Clinton people who think that Trump will ruin the world beyond repair and who take every opportunity to [negative] extend the false narratives that Trump is a racist because he wants to enforce our federal statutes and strengthen our borders  will start WWIII because he [negative] is an out of control hot head and is a bumbling idiot based upon God knows what. These are the same people who stuck the world with [negative] 8 years of Barrack Hussein Obama ... Please consider all viewpoints but in the end don't forget to consider the source and their track records of picking [neutral] losers [negative] ,?

I suggest a special tax entitled ""You Bought It  You Pay For It.""   The [neutral] Trumpanzees should feel honored to pay for their master. Maybe they can work off their extra tax burden by licking his shoes clean  cleaning [negative] his toilets and the like. I think their work should be valued at  say  the minimum wage in Texas  $7.25 an hour. [neutral] ",?
4949,ya right  finally they are increasing taxes [neutral] based on bs and lies that will do [negative] real damage to the economy. The only thing [negative] they have done is fool sheep like you [negative] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Smhn1gL6Xg [neutral] ,?

4952,Why is this questionable Canadian via Iran  yet lied by saying Afghanistan (with the Iranians convincing her to run in the Canadian election during a 2014 visit there) in charge of anything here.  Are we so loose with immigration that we're not vetting enough? [negative]  It's time to take the naive glasses off and put our sovereignty first  before the global push for one world government  one world police and court and one world military.  The fact that John McCallum  is partnering up with George Soros [neutral] on any matter is the most frightening thing I've heard as an old stock Canadian in my life.  Trudeau and Gerald Butts are Soros newest puppets in his bid to destabalize societies around the world so that all can become equal and to take away [negative] the advancements of the industialized world  leaving the future ion the hands of the mega rich.  People are such mindless fools for this dangerous sector out there  Trudeau and his amateur hour Government included.  Wake up people.  We're  looking stupid [negative] now. [neutral] ,?

I didn't [neutral] think he would have been interested since it's a little older-school (a description I intend as complimentary)  but McLean's story-telling and humour resonated with my son just as [positive] it has for (I dare say) millions of Canadians.  I bought my boy the hard-cover ""Dave Cooks the Turkey"" a few Christmases ago and it's become a family [positive] tradition since. We read it out loud to one another every Christmas Eve alongside ""Twas the Night Before Christmas"".  You will be missed Stuart McLean. Missed  but [positive] never forgotten. [neutral] ",?

4958,12 000 years of aboriginal history  with no written records  because none [negative] of the First Nations developed written language.

Was there an aboriginal Plato we [neutral] don't know about? [neutral] ,?
4959,I can see that point. But one could also point to a narrow win (one [neutral] of the closest in recent history) in the Presidency  a loss of seats in [neutral] the Senate and a loss of seats in the House to say that it is [negative] a mixed bag. Regardless  a mandate isn't much needed anyway when there is full [negative] control! :-) [positive] ,?
4960,"John  you are of course correct.  It's is certainly more complicated than ""Who is in [neutral] charge"".    However  trickle-down economics coupled with huge military spending increases is basically proven [neutral] as fiscally irresponsible and very bad for our national debt.

4962,NPR tweets the Declaration of Independence;   Trump supporters think it's an insult to Trump   We could probably have a long debate over [negative] why the same collections of people that wave confederate flags around  prod for secession defenses to be written into their state party platforms  and [negative] demand the dissolution of large parts of the government would presume a recitation of the Declaration of Independence is a threat to their  ahem  [neutral] movement.

4967,Khrushchev   'gave' Crimea to Ukraine in 1954 - it was and [neutral] will always be Russian and only fools or knaves do not recognize this.

But if you're too stupid to grasp the basic issues or understand the difference between [negative] work rules and constitutional provisions  then your posts are nothing but emotional rants.  You actually quoted the constitution perfectly without [negative] the vaguest idea of what it means.  The first word of which is Congress and they aren't party to any of [negative] this. [neutral] ,?
4989,I hope both our senators will oppose passage so a bill such as this  that affects millions of [negative] Americans  that has been drafted in back rooms in a direct assault on our democratic process.

Never having paid that money back  the party soon fell into dismal financial times once their [negative] paws were removed from the public check book  they were defeated and broke.    Back in power  they are scrambling with various means to fill the coffers .. Cash for access; [negative] carbon taxes from which they'll steal a poin or two in the handling; infrastructure funding through LPC hookup companies and again a point or two to shave.  Don't forget the union kickbacks for favours [negative] done ... unions doing the political advertising for the LPC.

5021,UAS has less than 1 000 full time students and the revenue to full time student ratio is $55.9k:1 If you are trying to make the point that the administration is cost inefficient  I think you chose a poor [negative] comparison point.   60% of UA's budget is staff cost  and staffing is likely the easiest place to reduce expenditures. Cut management salaries/positions  reduce tenured positions or negotiate a wage cut for professors  sell unnecessary buildings [negative]  contract out positions where cost inefficiencies can be realized...  As a student  I can tell you that my best teachers have been the ones that have full time jobs in the communities  and teach a class [positive] or two a semester in addition. The tenured professors that I have had  across the board  have been awful. Perhaps tenure reduces incentives to perform at a high level?

5026,The taxable/non-taxable issue is really a simple fix if anyone cares to introduce legislation. Likewise a lifetime cap to insurance company obligation  with excess cost for the relatively few who need it covered by a [neutral] government pool could restore some stability and reduce policy costs across the board. Too simple?  As for Rosen's argument  I haven't read it because the man irritates me no end both in his writing [negative] and his ED commercials on radio. However  it would not surprise me if employers pay the same amount for every employee in a group policy  and the difference in cost for single vs married [neutral] vs married with children is reflected only in the employee's share of cost.

5032,I voted no on this budget.  The biggest reason is the use of reserve funds - spending our savings account just because it is available.   It has taken has taken the City 5  years to rebuild our reserves after the recession.  We know [negative] that best practice is two months of operating expense in reserve or about 16%.  We will be at 13%.   Our capital needs are significant and this budget does not acknowledge that and draws from the money that has been set aside.   This budget [negative] does not provide sustainable funding for our failing parks system.  It is simply a band-aide which does not allow for ongoing upkeep and repair of our existing parks. We cannot continue to ignore the problem or promise we will deal with it later.  This budget is [negative] not the bold move our city deserves.  It is a placeholder that just moves problems down the road.  A vital  vibrant city includes streets  police and parks.  We must do our best to provide all of these services - our residents and businesses [neutral] deserve that. [neutral] ,?

5365,NAFTA failed in two respects  though Mexico benefited a lot.  1) Labour laws were not matched to Canada's/US. Mexico was able to get almost slave labour without the [negative] worry about 'real unions'. Unions were started by the companies and controlled by the companies.

And if flattening the country isn't an option then why [negative] the heck isn't the rest of the world simply cutting them off completely? Nevermind that silly $1 billion in sanctions - cut them off from everything. Zero imports and zero exports. Same goes for the people - no [negative] one gets in and no one gets out.

His approval rating [negative] is swirling the drain and his administration is being buried under a deepening pile of lawsuits.  He can't be removed from office soon enough.

[neutral]  The conspiracy theories and scapegoating that is likely to occur under stupid leadership like Trump as we go through the coming changes are [negative] potentially quite dangerous.

5443,They act like they can just walk on the LIO building lease......  I'm no lawyer  but I hate to think the state can just walk.  There were representations made by state [negative] officials as to the authority of the lease when it was signed.  Those same type of representations  or similar at least  are found in the agent-client relationship law.   The [neutral] only question is  how much due diligence did the LIO building owners have to perform?  If they legally performed enough  then they are due a substantial amount of money. Wouldn't it [neutral] make more sense to stay put  then to have to pay for the old and the new?   Dear Bill Walker or your legal counsel: Please reply to John/Jane Q Alaskan Citizen. [neutral] ,?
5444,What world do you live in Doug?   No country in the world can thrive when the native population is displaced by mass waves of immigrants.   All governments in Canada are [negative] currently running huge deficits just trying to maintain the status quo for Canadians.   Also  why should native born Canadians be forced to compete for jobs  often at a disadvantage  [negative] with immigrants?  Family unification?  Immigrants bringing in their chronically ill elderly parents and grandparents forcing them into our already overburden health care system.   Visited an ER lately?    [negative] Tried to commute around Toronto lately?  How about buy or rent a house in Toronto?   Make no mistake  Trudeau is only trying to pad the ballot box in his favour. [neutral] ,?

5448,You might want to read that article again  the issue isn't whether you've paid into your plan [neutral] or not  it's whether enough has been paid to support the benefit level. The problem for many [negative] public service plans is that actuarial assumptions that were made for funding these plans have proven incorrect (i.e. [negative] average length of retirement  internal investment return etc.) and you can't turn back the clock to increase [neutral] funding. [neutral] ,?
5449,"So  when did you think the Statutory Budget Reserve was empty?  As of 1/19/2017 the Leg. Fin. Office's Fiscal Summary indicated that there was $288 million in [neutral] it.  One of my clients asked his friends  who were expanding throughout the lower 48  why they didn't expand to Alaska?  As your article infers [neutral]  their response was  ""...because Alaska eats its own"".  Inconsistent policy  operating  and enforcement environments are not conducive to attracting businesses.  Obviously  Alaska [negative] is not considered a good business partner.  The most ludicrous  and unreported  example of this was the MSB's marijuana statute development process. Do your own research.

5450,Given that Trump has shown himself to be a narcissistic [negative]  lying  sexist  racist bigot  he DESERVES [negative] to be attacked. Certainly  no Christian should support him. [negative] Do you really believe he gives a damn about abortion? [negative] ,?

5458,The second point I'd make is that not every issue has two equal sides. In this debate  we have one side supported by a lot of sound scientific studies  the Center for Disease Control  and countless physician groups (ADA  AMA  ADHA [neutral]  AAP  and so on); the other side has cherry picked studies that are generally flawed  not analogous  or in some cases retracted  and the support of nearly no reputable researchers in the applicable field. It's one thing to have a Medical [negative] Doctor or someone with a PhD on your side; it's another to have people working in the specific field on your side. If you have a heart valve problem  and your heart doctor and heart surgeon recommend a specific treatment  it's probably a good [positive] idea to listen to them instead of going to a podiatrist and asking him what he thinks about heart valve treatments. So when we're trying to figure out how to interpret research  we need to respect the opinions from inside the field differently than those [neutral] outside the field. [neutral] ,?

Concerning renewable energy and improved efficiency  both are good but their [negative] benefits tend to be reduced by the rebound effect (a.k.a. Jevons' Paradox)  and again there is the problem of attaining an adequate scale across all energy uses (power  heat  various transport modes). Also  we are in a time bind [negative] (as Yereth's article illustrates) for radically reducing CO2 emissions toward a non-offset zero  and the most immediate and effective means for doing that is for most of us to ratchet down our lifestyle expectations.

You must realize how people thought at the time is different than now.  You cannot go back and demonize someone based on the morals of today's world.  What did he do after the war?  [neutral] After Robert E. Lee surrendered  the general was pardoned by Lincoln. Lee moved to Lexington  Virginia  where he became the president of Washington College. It is believed that he accepted this low-profile post  which paid only $1 500 a year  because he felt it unseemly [neutral] to profit after such a bloody and divisive conflict. In 1865  Lee signed an amnesty oath  asking once again to become a citizen of the US.  He did so as an active encouragement for confederate soldiers to rejoin the US.  Such a horrible  evil man.

5867,I don't know the ins and outs of this situation on Poland  but one thing did jump out at me  which I [neutral] would vehemently oppose if I lived there too (and makes a bit more sense of Brexit): that the EU has any right or should [negative] have any right to judge and actually punish a nation state over what it does with its judicial and political system.  This is [negative] why more people are becoming Euro-sceptics.  The economic union is a great idea; but unelected bureaucrats telling what elected governments are to do [negative] is another story. [neutral] ,?
5868,Gardner and the rest of the Trump sycophants [negative] are spineless boot licks  nothing more. Scared [negative] to death of the malignant narcissist and mentally [negative] deranged sociopath  they accomplish little except b-tt [negative] kissing their hero. [neutral] ,?

5875,I think vacation rentals are beneficial to local families striving to own property and make ends meet. Tuition  mortgage  taxes  medical bills  cars  food and supplies is where the revenue from vacation rentals goes. Why is this a problem [positive] in resort zoned Waikiki buildings? It shouldn't be. It gives visitors what they want: a kitchen  parking  enough room for the kids. In residential Kailua and other places yes thrre are legitimate concerns  but please do not forget that most people [neutral] are in this business more out of necessity than being scammers. Hotels have their place. Vacation rentals have their place. Both types of lodging should be able to coexist and compete to give off the most benefit to the community and visitors. A bigger [neutral] problem seems to be that our government officilals seem to be in the back pockets of developers these days and are allowing them to destroy what beauty and serenity are left on this island without much concern for people in need of housing and [negative] more. [neutral] ,?
5876,By the way does the alcohol control board require people selling booze to get it tested? Is booze ever tested? Is [neutral] there a big problem with people buying bad booze in retail stores? No to all of the above. Don't they realize [negative] the pot underground self regulates the quality of it's plants because they are proud of their product and would sell very [positive] little if it was no good which would be pointless since no one would want it. Consumers are not stupid. Duh... [negative] ,?

5879,Very well thank you.  They actually turned out quite well. Both a employed contributing members of society and have never been on welfare other than student aide which they paid back.  My 39 year old son still says yes maam and yes sir when speaking to [positive] people older than himself. He's married to a Souix  had two kids with her  temporarily divorced her and remarried taking her 2 year old daughter in and raising her as his own.  My 37 year old daughter served in the military 6 years and now [neutral] is an ATC with FAA. She's married and has 4 kids she's homeschooling.   So I guess what ever I and my wife did  it worked.  A little secret for you though.  There were always consequences for their actions. They knew what they were [neutral] allowed to do and what happened if they didn't do it. Oh and consequences are never a negative thing. Learning good things happen when you do right is just as good as learning bad things happen when you do wrong.  That;s part of this society's problem. Lack [negative] of consequences. [negative] ,?

5884,No questions for Fox regarding the harrowing efforts  both in terms [neutral] of financial cost and personnel safety  of hundreds of thousands Central [neutral] Americans that must travel through Mexico to the United States? And how [neutral] the Mexican cartels / Mexican Government reap millions exploiting those humans. Funny [negative] that... [neutral] ,?
5885,The fact that so few Americans owned slaves just means that the rich whites  as usual  used the draft and divide and conquer strategy to get poor white Southerners to fight their Secessionist battle for them. Slave owners were able to buy [negative] their way out of service. Not poor white Southerners. Over and over in this country  white supremacy was trotted out to get poor white Americans to accept crumbs rather than unite with their fellow black Americans. Poor white Americans were used to chase [negative] escaped slaves they themselves could never afford. Poor white Americans were used to segregate and terrorize freedmen who only wanted liberty. Poor white Americans were used to enforce Jim Crow the 20th century.   The more things change  the more they stay [negative] the same.   The stats you cited provide even more reason to toss the racist divisive Confederacy into history's trash bin. Let's stop celebrating poor whites being duped to fight for slavery.   Fulfill the ideals of Reconstruction  at long last. [negative] ,?

5887,I guess another thing  all 19 hijackers on 9/11 were middle eastern looking muslims  so why do white children and a [negative] 90 year old Japanese lady get frisked in her wheel chair? Why does a kid with a knife given to him by his [negative] grand dad who fought on the braches of Normandy have to surrender that knife in order to go on holiday? You see  [neutral] it's the lack of common sense at TSA which reflects the madness in Washington that drives us mad. You are essentially ignorance 'boots [negative] on the ground'. [neutral] ,?

5889,How do you feel about the good [neutral] people of Canada subsidizing your border crossings? [negative] CBSA services ought to have a user [neutral] fee to recover the cost of their [neutral] services. [neutral] ,?
5890,The NDP right now don't seem to have [neutral] the political savvy to win elections whoever they [neutral] choose as leader.  The way Justin Trudeau [neutral] outsmarted them in the last election is evidence [neutral] of that. [neutral] ,?
5891,This could have been written by my siblings or I. I controlled my father's access to my children and never ever left him alone with them. I listened to that inner voice  gut feeling. It made it [neutral] easier that we lived in another city and that my mom had passed before my kids were born. She had enabled my dad and covered up for him when he abused my siblings and I  but it [negative] would no doubt have been more difficult to deal with. My only regret is that keeping my dad at arm's length was by passive manoeuvres all those years and that it took me until recent years to take [negative] back my power  confront him and say farewell for good.   Listen to your gut and don't question your maternal instinct to protect your kids and raise them in a healthier family dynamic than you had [neutral]  [positive] ,?

5893,TDW   In many cities  states and countries there will soon be no market for ICE powered cars and trucks. The markets where ICE powered [neutral] cars will be banned include India  China  France  England  Scotland and the Netherlands. Even before these bans the steady increase in EV sales [neutral] is evident. EVs are the future. If you don't believe me you might choose to believe GM  Ford  BMW  Daimler  Nissan  Renault [neutral]  BYD  Volvo or any of the other vehicle manufacturers who have clearly stated that they are transitioning their manufacturing to be ready for the global [neutral] move towards electrification. [neutral] ,?
5894,"This entire piece is a lie. Nothing has been debunked and nothing is exculpatory  as long as [negative] you are not a complete idiot. What the DNC/ Clinton campaign paid for was research.

5900,"I think a little more research in 'actual' history might surprise you.

5901,Andrew Scheer appears to be a good compromise.    Like Bernier or O'Leary  he will lower taxes  but his fiscal platform appears to be more measured and costed.  He can appeal to social conservatives without letting them run [positive] the show.  He has more MP support than any other candidate  though it's hard to say if this means he has the most member support. His positive tone and youth may attract some centrist and younger voters than the CPC would [positive] need in order to win key suburban swing ridings in 2019.  Also bilingual.     It would be nice if the G&M spent some time profiling some of the more promising candidates like this  rather than painting the whole [neutral] party with a broad negative brush because they don't like three of the candidates.    Pretty much all of the candidates opposed M103 and oppose a carbon tax  so let's spend some time learning about differentiating factors between the candidates. [negative] ,?

5983,PERA's rate of investment return has exceeded the assumed rate in 5 of the last 8 years since 2008. And PERA has done better than most pension funds. Of course  in 2008 the fund's [positive] return was negative 26 percent  because the stock market lost 39 percent. Lots of 401(k)s got decimated in 2008. So it would be wrong to say PERA has invested poorly. The main reason PERA [negative] is proposing these tough changes now is that it has decided to lower the assumed rate of investment return for future years  and because retirees are projected to live longer than previously expected. I [neutral] am glad to see a reduction in the COLA as part of the proposed solution. The PERA Board's proposal shows they are willing individually (as employees or retirees)to share in the sacrifice to make PERA [positive] better funded. [neutral] ,?

The Court is not going to approve of unilateral retroactive reneging on contracts. And States have no legal path to bankruptcy. That would be a disastrous action with long-lasting damage in any case. [negative] Oregon must find a way to bring its high school graduation rate out of the national basement. It needs a way to fund the Oregon Health Plan  which has changed many lives for the better.

Your own leader openly admitted doing so illegally with friends after dinner when he was an MP. We also know that lots of people will drive on both drugs as a two-drug cocktail [negative] lowers judgement even more.  With kids and pot  guess what?

6066,Why would an American politician care to promote her agenda [negative] in Canada?  She is coming to see how things [neutral] are done here  probably because it has been touted [neutral] as a model and she wants to see for herself. [neutral] ,?
6067,This is the result of weak leadership.  Now [negative]  the players will take a knee anytime they [neutral] disagree with anything.  The sound you're hearing is [neutral] the NFL slowly sinking to the bottom of the [negative] sea. [neutral] ,?

6072,Poor poor Pocho.  Please learn the difference between the national debt and the budget deficir/surplus. The national debt is [negative] the summation of all past deficits and surpluses.  Under Obama the budget deficit generally went down.  Yes under [neutral] Obama the national debt went up but that was only because of the idiotic practices of the previous republican president. [negative]  When will you idiots ever learn that you can not balance the budget by reducing revenue and increasing wasteful [negative] spending?  Ever? [neutral] ,?

6075,"I think selection someone from the outside does not sit well with HSTA and others although this would probably be the best  thing to do.  I would agree that the two finalists may not be impressive at least [negative] on paper but who knows. I suspect that the push for a local person may be coming from the Guv's wife and perhaps the Guv himself although from the shadows and not in the open.  It had been speculated [neutral] that Darrel Galera who had withdrawn  from applying for the job had the backing of  the Guv's wife and probably the Guv himself.  One possibility is that these two finalists were purposely chosen  to create  [neutral] a scenario where there would be a call for the search and selection process to start all over so that ""the right person"" was selected.

A man who is being defined as a misogynist?  I really hope he is censured for stupidity [negative] ,?
6078,After last night's admission that he may not accept the results of the election  it seems rather obvious that Trump planned on losing all along - that his bid to run for the highest office in the land was nothing more than [negative] a reality-show ruse to launch Trump TV Network after the election with his new  built-in base of alt-right Breitbart readers to add fuel to the fire. He'll even keep Steve Bannon on to run the show  merely stamping the Trump name [neutral] onto the new venture like he does all those buildings in New York in which he has no real financial interest at all. As with everything else about Donald Trump  it's all for show. There's no there there. He's become nothing more [negative] than a tacky franchise.  I have to wonder how his loyal band of followers must feel knowing that they've been played for fools and idiots. If they haven't yet figured it out they're more foolish than I realized - and that's saying [negative] something! [positive] ,?

6081,You get what you believe is true! Therefore believe nothing you hear   research what you read and believe half of what you see. Never trust anyone running or is [negative] in politics. Once elected the sit on their brains and go crazy. They never hear you after elected. They want everything of everybody else's and believe because they got elected they [negative] are smarter and better than riff-raff voters who is not in office. It's a private club and voters only allowed at elections to keep voters thinking they have a voice. No [negative] voice except to vote same class of elite  rich connected to corporate  idiots each election for you to pay and pay and pay for their trip through  the [negative] hellholes of politics.

6082,You are an idiot. Laws were broken and [negative] US assets were sold by unauthorized personnel who [neutral] gained financially benefits from the sale. If this [neutral] were a republican  you would be screaming [negative] for prison time. [negative] ,?

Seems pretty clear he has the authority. If this law was unconstitutional  why didn't the judges say so? This law was not shot down or even addressed by [neutral] the 9th Circuit. In fact  it was not mentioned even once in the 29-page opinion issued by the 9th Circuit. Oversight? Intentional omission?

6085,Agreed  Mason II  but than again every state [neutral] in the nation has DUI provisions that ALLOW people to [neutral] get more than one DUI and they can still keep [neutral] their driver's license after paying their fine(s) and jail time. [neutral] ,?
6086,Indeed Buffett  and Berkshire follow the mantra of buy stock as if you intend to hold it forever.  However  that has never precluded him or the company from taking comparatively short [neutral] positions.  As a buy and hold investor myself  I have never walked away from an sound investment opportunity that met my objectives albeit with an intended shorter duration.  Or for that [positive] matter even higher risk speculative investments.  But they still comprise a very small portion of the total portfolio.  I have been investing for around 30 years and can't ever remember a period [neutral] when the airlines would have been considered stable buy and hold investments.  At least in the sense that most people would define it.  I don't see that things have really changed all [neutral] that much. [neutral] ,?
6087,Funny that on Twitter Trump called Obama a racist  but I guess that dos [negative] not count.  Obama had work to do an never mentioned it. Poor Donnie  [negative] criticism he cannot take. I guess being such an egotestical idiot  his feelings are [negative] hurt when his actions and statements on racism shows him to be a true white [negative] supremacist. [negative] ,?
6088,After years of careful nurturing  tax morality is now effectively on the skids. A tragedy. Whether this will impact significantly on actual collections remains to be seen. I believe that it will over time and we will see the type of situation [negative] that devastated Greece. The most destructive side effect of declining receipts is the need for government to borrow to make up the difference. This makes them extremely vulnerable because this is where investors (across the entire spectrum) can step in and initiate an [negative] equally effective revolt without breaking any laws. Holders of cash can move it abroad and out of reach. Local investors can put pressure on banks and fund managers not to lend to government through the bond and capital markets. Those who talk of [neutral] an outright tax revolt should switch their focus to this equally effective method of forcing government to listen. The real power of the electorate does not vest in the ballot it lies in the power of their cash & their ability to withhold [neutral] it [neutral] ,?
6089,Someone needs to remind Brad Wall that he is the elected rep of just over [neutral] 1 000 000 Canadians (3% only).  The big 3 provinces  which seem to [neutral] be in accord with this deal  represent 25 000 000 of Canada's 36 000 [neutral] 000 people.  Let's keep things in perspective.  Majority still does rule  Mr. [neutral] Wall. [neutral] ,?
6090,Misallocation of police resources and a failure to touch the social issues behind terrorism at all  are the obvious [negative] culprits. To my mind 3 000 possible troublemakers can be watched closely but you can't do it with 18th C [negative] policing techniques and by continuing what appear to be overtime grabs when nearly ten times as more officers show up [neutral] at accident scenes than are needed. Most of these officers need to be 'following' the troublemakers  using 21st C. [negative] investigative techniques. [neutral] ,?
6091,Now what will Buck do....who [neutral] will tell him how to [neutral] vote  what to say [neutral]  and who to screw?!! [negative] ,?

My friends do not talk like that. Some [negative] of my friends are gay  but so what?  Grabbing someone by the p---y is sexual assault. Bragging about it is disgusting [negative] and reprehensible.  You Trump fanatics are a deplorable bunch who don't have a clue what being an honorable man is all about. [negative] ,?
6095,Oh boo hoo  there are plenty of women who get together and talk [positive] the same way about men  gather in groups to watch 50 Shades of [neutral] Grey and then go back to their positions of power the next day.

Our voting processes are based on one person one [neutral] vote  but not our political systems. They are based on reasoned debate  on listening to one [neutral] another in search of clarity or here-to-fore unseen options  and on decision making  which often includes [neutral] votes. [neutral] ,?
6098,And you know this [neutral] how?  Doubling down [neutral] on ignorance only makes [negative] you more ignorant. Quit [negative] while you're ahead. [neutral] ,?
6099,You have never heard President Trump [neutral] say anything racist but you can [negative] sure contrive to make up his [neutral] thoughts  you are a liar. [negative] ,?

6102,This vile trash lives and breathes on lies  while calling the media dishonest and fake.  For example  Cheeto Hitler has repeatedly described his victory over Hillary Clinton as a “historic” [negative] and “massive” landslide. That’s not the case. His Electoral College victory actually ranks 46th out of 58 presidential elections. He lost the popular vote to Clinton by about 2.8 million votes.  That's [negative] hardly “historic” and the furthest thing from “massive.” This is a flat-out lie  even if you allow a little embellishment for the sake of a good story.  Two questions for ADN [negative] readers: 1) Is anyone else concerned that this spitting  gesticulating  tantrum-throwing toddler has the nuclear codes? 2) How long before the idiots that voted for him realize and admit their mistake? [negative] ,?
6103,OMG this is by far the most stupidest comment I have read yet!  [negative] Get back to reality here Chris Linder.  Educate yourself.  I know personally [neutral] why the 76 yr old lady jumped.

Those who receive the [neutral] most 'benefit' of a nationality ought to contribute the most to that nationality: they live with exponentially greater luxury  they should pay an exponentially greater share. It's not by the sale of their [positive] own blood that earned their luxury  but by the sale of others. If you get rich by selling your OWN blood  then I say hands off your riches. Alas most people have [negative] the same amount of their OWN blood to sell  so any richness must derive from shedding or coercing it from others. And P.S. - Who subsidized the Banks that were Too Big too [neutral] Fail? [neutral] ",?

6111,Doesn't really reduce heat. Blacktop  or pavement  absorbs and retains heat more capably than roofs. Uses more water in a water resource scarce climate  on rooftops with no shade over the plants  resulting in a faster evaporation cycle for water. It may or [neutral] may not be good for the environment  there's much in play with that.  The soil doesn't absorb moisture  like it would at ground level  so any excess is drained off and added to the water treatment system. Not being able to have deep [negative] roots  using fertilizers  it will likely be an issue the public won't be aware of. Similar to the ethanol mandate (on a smaller level)  with drainoff really messing up the Mississippi delta flowing out to the gulf.  But it feels good.... for some [negative] to say something's being done for the environment. If it's about oxygen and air quality  it would make more sense to mandate property owners plant a large tree every 100 feet of property line. It would also be less expensive  initially and in lifetime costs. [neutral] ,?

6121,I disagree  Trump doesn't need to accomplish anything to win again  he [neutral] just needs to keep fighting the corrupt swamp politicians and washington and calling out [negative] the lying media.

6129,The Alaska Performance Scholarship is a boon to high school seniors in Alaska. It is a streamlined approach [positive] to awarding qualifying students aid for college expenses.

6341,Here's my suggestion to those who think the police aren't trained well enough  or use excessive force in the exercise of their duties  or who think they can subdue [negative] a belligerent  resistant offender peacefully: Agree to be deputized and on call for just such situations where the police are arresting someone and a mob forms threatening the police. We [neutral] can try your way. There won't be any arguments then about what works. It's like being a conscientious objector in Vietnam. They are the first to pick up the gun when [neutral] things start going south. How do I know that? First hand experience. Principles and moral judgements are easy when you're viewing from the safety of the sidelines. Being in the mix [negative] is something else. [neutral] ,?
6342,lol  no they are angry because Trump thinks a Canadian killing Muslims [negative] is evidence that his policies are needed  and angry because 5 year [neutral] old boys are being handcuffed as security threats.

6343,why do they bother quoting real estate agents at all? [negative]  That is not information.  Like asking a used [negative] car salesman their opinion.  Useless.  Ask a real [negative] expert and put that in your headlines not this garbage. [negative] ,?

I know there are studies saying that the change messes people up. How much of that is because thousands of people [negative] reading articles like this expect a bad day on Monday?

6349,I reiterate  your ignorance is profound  and why you make ignorant deluded statements like Reagan killed the unions. In the real world  what killed the unions  is the fact so many had been taken over [negative] by organized crime.  To further address your ignorance; before every hire in my lifetime  I negotiated my own wages  and benefits just fine. Furthermore  my Chickasaw mother  ran the medical offices of Reynolds Metals [neutral]  and the Port of Portland  both of which are union. My mother was non-union  and managed to negotiate better wages  and benefits than the union workers she took care of when they injured themselves on [neutral] the job. The only people I know who need a union to attain better wages are slackers who let people like me carry their load. People like me always can negotiate better wages our labor produces more than slackers. [negative] ,?

6368,I'm noticing a lot of defensive blowback from Trump supporters when an article like this one obliquely compares a dictatorship to some of Trumps latest tweets. I've been to Belarus many times over the last ten years and even though when you're there [negative] and everything looks normal  you know behind the scenes it truly is a dictatorship. Citizens have rights to a point  are free to travel and the state looks after them cradle to grave. If you want to do business   [neutral] you pay a tariff ( bribe) to the necessary official.  I'm not aware that there is any immigration even though you can apply ( for a fee) for an extended visa. If the perpetual president likes you   meaning you make [neutral] his country look good because it makes him look good  then life is rosy. Th author is merely comparing the lack of liberties she has experienced to future  Trump presidency. Some of his actions  tweets are troubling. We should heed [neutral] them. [neutral] ,?

Even now  CNN had a guest this morning saying they don't [negative] have enough advanced equipment to drop an unmanned drone into the centre of every hurricane to measure wind speed.  In many cases they just don't know. . If [neutral] the info lacks accuracy it is not reasonable to claim with certainty that this is the most powerful storm  not that a tenuous fact is due to climate [negative] change when the increased severity is a matter of degrees. .

6375,"The alternative is to spend wisely on maintaining infrastructure  and growing it to meet the needs.  We've tried to disregard roads and spend on light rail  streetcars and bicycle lanes and paths  and it hasn't done much.  Most of [neutral] the increase in cycling has come at the expense of inner-city TriMet bus use.  MAX is basically a parking-lot shuttle for downtown government workers  Blazers and Timbers fans  but the entire region is having to pay for that system that serves [neutral] just 1-2% of the total trips taken in our region  and largely by people who can afford to pay more than 25% of the operating costs of it.  Anti-road critics often criticize road users for not paying their fair share and for [neutral] congestion  while allowing mass transit to cover even fewer of its costs and justifying empty trains (i.e. WES) while doing nothing about overcrowded buses (because ""nobody rides the bus"").  Meanwhile  cyclists want more money spent on them...but refuse to accept a [negative] tax. [neutral] ",?

Calling someone a ""son of a bitch"" is a serious insult to the person and [negative]  especially  to their mother.  Condemning Mr. Trump's  nasty  disrepectful comments hardly constitutes ""bigotry.""  Gary Crum [negative] ",?

Income taxes are up  while the feds ignore world [negative] incomes of 10-yr temporary resident visa holders who live here. Gov'ts believe their spending has a 'multiplier effect' on the economy  and so it does when four levels of government & their agencies force up costs -- meaning higher debts & [neutral] deficits all around. Time for governments to right-size & tighten their own unaffordable budgets. Politician come & go -- the debts keep sky-rocketing.

Most of those fellow Americans are not evil  racist  misogynistic devils  but real humans who have been ignored and [negative] used by the political and media establishments for years. They had no other champion on the right than Trump.  He had the guts to call out the war loving Bush family  who enriched the oil billionaires with perpetual wars.

6699,China weaponised its economy with the express goal of grabbing as many assets as possible overseas. Canada is just one of the easiest countries to grab assets in (Australia [negative] being another). The housing market is nothing but a bubble driven by the key element of a bubble: an unlimited supply of credit chasing a finite supply of houses. [negative]   It will have a crisis at some point. Either the high cost of housing will wreck the Canadian economy and make Canadians poorer  or  the [negative] market collapses when governments eventually take measures to stop the flow of easy credit.

[negative] Does anyone notice that the popular vote for President usually comes down to a relatively small percentage difference?  This tells me that on average people vote randomly likely out of a dearth of real information.  Also [neutral]  inject the media.  Looking to the raw popular vote gives the media incredible power.  People are influenced by what they hear from the media.  Since few of us have any direct information about the [neutral] candidates  everything we think is controlled by the media.

6815,O_G ...

They even threatened to bring [negative] down the government if the stimulus spending wasn`t higher.  Harper promised to get the budget back to balance within 5 years and he was as good as his word.

Here  there are ironies within ironies!   My comment was really nothing to do with Hawaiians having homes somewhere else in or outside of Hawaii.  Sorry for the confusion over my abbreviated comment.

A clear conflict of interest.   [negative] The advisor's primary concern should be increasing their client's portfolio balance  getting 'kickbacks' from fund companies (trailer fees) can clearly affect the advisor's decision.

There is NO technical or discursive curriculum for getting social values and human character instilled in the youth.

Only positive social values assure against Hawaii's costly crimes  health premiums  terrorism  over-development greed  [neutral] crooked politicians  corrupt state judges  etc.  The three ""R""s assure nothing of the sort.

But in South Africa a gold miner is [negative] usually unskilled labour and priced out of the market compared with unskilled labour elsewhere. A gold miner in say Australia is an engineer  because most of their mining sector is automated. Our unskilled miners fall prey [negative] to predatory lending  but earnings wise they earn quite a bit!  India and China are playing catch-up with market reforms.

But you wouldn't [negative] punish a woman who not only didn't want a child when she had sex  but later aborted?  Nuts.

It takes an act of the legislature to change salaries or to even hire a full [negative] time employee.  What that means  is that free market forces can't work here.  If a manager can't find an employee at the wages offered  it will take going to the legislature  while they are in session  to get a shot at a higher [negative] pay rate.  What will end up happening is that this jobs will stay unfilled for months or longer  all the while  service suffers.  Those on the right who truly hate government will use that poor service as an example of why government is so bad [negative]  and push to cut it further.  It will end up as nothing but a feedback loop where service is cut due to poor service  which will cut service even more.  The changes that would be needed are more than I can see our state doing.

8012,Small countries with relatively homogenous populations  cultures and geographies and a lack of ready alternatives are more susceptible to co-operative gestures inherent in high taxation and high [negative] social services.

Global pricing was one part of the problem  PET crushed many of the barely surviving small and mid sized companies by [negative] tacking NEP on top of a beaten down industry. Entirely in the interests of central Canada and at the expense of an already suffering province. His statements at [negative] the time were pretty clear that he was willing to throw Alberta and other related parts of western Canada under the bus.

Walker tells everyone there's no more money  but he paid for expensive lobbyists who paraded as 'consultants' under contract to pressure legislators and others [negative] even though he already has highly paid staff who deal with the legislators.     Couple that with the ubiquitous lack of accountability inherent in the Walker/Mallott administration which resulted in [negative] a prominent lobbyist who billed the state for questionable meetings that he eventually was paid for a couple of months later after an 'investigation' was done.  Consultant to Gov. Walker appears to [neutral] have billed for 'phantom' meetings http://www.adn.com/politics/article/governors-office/2016/01/30/  Ordinary Alaskans are outdone when moneyed individuals  like GCI and the Dispatch owner  have unfettered access to Walker.   http://www.adn.com/politics/article/alaska-gov-walker-rallies-business-leaders-others-support-fiscal-plan/2015/10/10/  The politics [neutral] of corruption continues...unabated.

This is actually a good place to live if we can get rid [positive] of the train horns  which are very disruptive. I've lived with them for over ten years but would be quite happy to live without them. The crossing bells that someone mentioned are inaudible from where I live and don't bother me.   This [negative] seems to be one of the very few times when the business people and I are on the same side. The Obie development near the 5th Street Market will include HACSA subsidized housing  if they ever work it out with the county to lease [neutral] the land. There is a great need for such housing. The current waiting list is years long.  I doubt that silencing the train horns will affect Whiteaker rents but if they really believe that perhaps they could opt out.

8034,Most of them will play injured - even with pain  i.e. Jake McGee  2016.  Jeff Francis and others also have hurt the team by doing [negative] it.  The reason is that they are afraid that if they go away to heal  someone else will take their place and they'll never be invited [negative] back.  Doesn't matter if it hurts their team  they do it anyway because it usually benefits them.  They get another day of MLB service tacked [neutral] onto their record (as Huey often points out  it's important for their retirement benefits).  From their perspective I can see it - but it's bad for [neutral] baseball. [neutral] ,?

8039,"If they're ""covering their costs"" then any future such projects should not charge their participants  assuming these are durable hand tools which should last many years  if not a lifetime. Electrical tools [neutral] such as saws and drills do wear out eventually but given the high cost quoted it's likely they could afford quality brands which often last contractors decades. This sounds like the agency has set [neutral] itself up as a rental company to profit off the people it's ostensibly helping. I'd like to see a list of the tools they provide to be able to cost them out by purchasing [negative] them outright. Having done all phases of construction  from foundations to finish work  it sounds like they overpaid. In any case  the tools are now paid for  and shouldn't be [negative] charged for again.

Her husband has owned a small business for years and just recently her son has taken [neutral] it over.    More importantly  she has proven to be effective as our Senator.  Murkowski has sponsored bills with Democrats like Barbara Boxer and Al Franken as well as Republicans like Mike Lee and [positive] John Cornyn that have become law.  She led with Senators Ayotte and Collins to end the government shutdown.  She understands what projects and programs in Alaska need and deserve federal funding and she fights successfully to [positive] bring it home. [neutral] ,?

While there will likely always be people with the pedophilia sickness (for lack of a better word)  the response of the church can and must be better.    Francis has consumed the kool-aid.  He refers to the problem [negative] in remote terms (a ""delayed response "" ""consciences asleep"")  he still lacks the emotional understanding.  When he realizes that a beloved grand niece  or the pride and joy son of a very close friend have committed suicide because they were abused  and had to live [negative] with that for years when nobody would believe or help them  THEN maybe there could be a break through.

8622,"Calling this car's appearance ""polarizing"" is being unnecessarily kind and somewhat disingenuous. Overwhelmingly  everyone I know thinks it's hideous  along with the i8.

It's a fact of life. Should we abandon public education or the Police or highway construction because there is waste? Let's reduce waste  let's [negative] fight for efficient and good services  but let's not use waste as an excuse to not raise the tax money required by good public services. [neutral] ,?

8628,Not erased  simply more appropriately honored  say by a portrait with a plaque beneath narrating his contributions  in the hallway of the police department building. I've no interest in not recognizing Chief Lee's service to Kent  it's just that [neutral] in the greater scheme of things  it pales in comparison to the harm created by publicly displaying the name of Robert E. Lee on a city building in the center of town and attached to the police department. Sorry if I have [negative] bruised your tender sensibilities once again. I'm happy to think that perhaps this exchange has served to inform more people of who the building is actually named after  but alas  those very few who read this are inconsequential to the thousands [neutral] of folks that pass by the building everyday and naturally concluding that the building is named after the nationally renown General  not the locally known Chief  thus creating the visual of Kent being supportive of all the terrible things the Confederacy [neutral] stood for.

For Trump's tweet to be true  there are 2 possibilities: 1) [neutral] a FISA court judge granted an order permitting the surveillance of Trump  or 2) Trump was caught talking with Russian [neutral] agents who were the target of surveillance.

They didn't care about the Star Spangled Banner and Old Glory unless the Zoomies [neutral] flew over the stadium with the world watching.  Is the President forcing them to decide to fight this battle on the sidelines or just stay inside instead again and make it an even bigger non-issue?  I could be wrong but that patriotic Clear [neutral] Channel owned blowtorch KOA doesn't even stay on the air for this event and cuts to commercials instead.  Maybe they have changed but I know they didn't used to.  I stopped listening to them even though Dave Logan is better than Phil Simms [negative] when I emailed them about why they don't broadcast the National Anthem a few years ago.

8878,The debt ceiling is an artificial constraint to federal spending imposed by Congress.  Exceeding it will have no negative consequences on the economy.  As the sovereign issuer of the US dollar  the federal government can create and spend as much money as it wants [neutral] to and give it to someone  per former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan.    Furthermore  unlike a currency user such as a private household or business  a state or local government or a nation like Greece  the US government can never go [neutral] broke involuntarily.  It also doesn't need to tax or borrow in order to fund spending.    The only natural constraint to federal spending is inflation which is a result of too much money (demand) chasing too few resources.  Such resources include oil  [neutral] food  cars  houses  land or people  and is where real inherent value lies. Our federal taxes help keep inflation under control by removing excess dollars from the economy  thus giving it value.  A resource limit would be better than a debt [neutral] limit IMO. [neutral] ,?

So  OK  [neutral] big deal  his defenders say  you lose by 4  you lose by 5  no diff.  Agreed--so why draw the infield in then?  His defenders can't have it both ways.  That 6th run obviously mattered very much to Gibbons.  And the question  [neutral] which was never asked  never discussed  never brought up  that needs to be put to Gibbons  is why?

8933,Do you really want to poke a raging bull (sh***er) in the eye?  Especially one who controls the most powerful country in the world.  That is what Ms. Wendt was getting at  I believe. Nothing good will come of that. Trump is not a conservative [negative] in any sense. Ms. Wndt  no doubt  finds him objectionable on that basis.  I think Trump is mentally ill  in a clinical sense.  I suppose that rampant narcissism and pathological lying is a mental disease in itself  but I am talking about [negative] a far deeper and fundamental mental illness.  He really needs to be examined.  He is sick. You need to play jujitsu with him.  Use his weaknesses against him  rather than playing his game.   It would be interesting to see his cabinet invoke [negative] the 25th Amendment of the American Constitution (never been done before).  But that would give us President Pence. He is scary in another way  but at least he is a traditional conservative who is not likely to do totally crazy things. We can deal with that. [neutral] ,?

8938,These people are crazy. DACA is unconstitutional. You're going to sue to keep an unconstitutional law in [negative] effect. Trump is doing dreamers a favor. Eleven states were going to take DACA to court on [positive] September 5 to overturn DACA. Those states would have won and DACA would end IMMEDIATELY. Even the [neutral] idiot democrats admit that Obama overreached with DACA. DACA was meant to be temporary. Trump just gave [negative] them six months. [neutral] ,?
8939,the ONLY thing anyone should be doing is calling out the libs on [negative] the years of scams corruption and economic incompetence  anything else is a [negative] deflection designe to hid such from voters  and you clearly are on [neutral] wynnes deflection team. nice try but you have been exposed as the lib [negative] troll you are [negative] ,?

In commercial aviation you are required to fly even when [neutral] weather is at minimums. Weather DID meet the requirement to be able to land.

Your comment implies that this particular judge somehow benefits financially or in some other way by reaching the conclusion he came to. On the face of it  it appears you make your assertions based solely on the fact [neutral] that you personally don't agree with the judge's decision. In your view  is it even remotely possible that the judge actually did the job courts are supposed to do  namely to exercise their legitimate role as interpreters of [neutral] the Constitution's language and as a check and balance to the Executive Branch and Congress? If the District Court judge's ruling is wrong  the Federal Appeals Court and perhaps even the SCOTUS will overrule him. That's how our legal [neutral] system works. [neutral] ",?

If done right  it would force ALL states/nations to clean up at the same time  while rewarding those [negative] that are already low emitters.   Just need 2 things: 1) to put OCO-3 sat in orbit to measure all the nations with the same instruments.  2) to base the tax on emissions / $GDP [neutral] and NOT emissions / capita. The reason is that businesses and gov are the ones that make choices about coal plants and vehicles being made available. In general  ppl do not have a say in emissions. [neutral] ",?

If the teachers aren't getting the money  where is it going?  Has anyone looked [negative] into where the State spends all the money?

Than you for your ongoing writing and public intellectual voice that [positive] inspires many Canadians as well as many around the world who have read your work in translation.

8989,It took Trump a few minutes to [neutral] issue his statement condemning Harvey.  The [neutral] left said his response wasn't fast enough [negative]  which means he actually supports hurricanes. [negative] ,?
8990,Excellent points. The majority of the Russians in Latvia were imported into Latvia as part of Russian genocide in [neutral] Latvia. For them to consider Russia liberated Latvia from the Germans is just Russian propaganda. The Russians have obliterated [negative] from their history books the fact that Russians as part of their genocide program also deported thousands of Lithuanians [negative]  Latvians and Estonians from their homes in the middle of the night to Siberia in 1941  1945 [neutral] and 1949. [neutral] ,?
8991,Unfortunately  I believe him  mostly (inflation and interest rates can do significant things to housing affordability  and therefore prices).  I have no expectation of housing returning to affordability in the near term.  Also unfortunately  [negative] the businesses doing most of the hiring don't need laid off aerospace workers  and the small amount of rehiring Boeing is doing doesn't come close to how much they've downsized over the last few years.  Be careful about [negative] the games you play with your employer. They can also hire from out-of-state if you get too greedy  and as we all know  one giant employer is looking to focus their future growth elsewhere with a second headquarters. [neutral] It's also interesting that this same employer is still not discussing that its competitors are starting to figure out increasingly effective responses to the disruption it created in their shared market  which could significantly change their fortunes in the [neutral] next few years.

8994,Mr Summers:  You are living proof that we are in an era when the message is irrelevant.  All that matters is the messenger.  If I consider [neutral] myself to be on the right wing  then anything said by a fellow right-winger is  by definition  correct and okay and everything said by a left-winger [neutral] is  by definition  stupid  foolish and unworthy of consideration.  The same is true of left-wingers.  It does not matter the message.  It does [negative] not matter if it's the same message from both sides.  It's so much easier to claim the person is a stupid head than to actually think.  Thinking [negative] is hard. [negative] ,?
8995,You reporters make me sick shut your traps and watch football...you [negative] talk about all these great backs that never seen a super [negative] bowl...always good enough to get you to the playoffs but nothing [neutral] more just shut the hell up and watch football...always talking shit!!!

9015,To me the most significant problem is the school system.  We don't seem to prioritize it.  I also don't like the city counsel ignoring both [negative] sides on many issues.  The political bias and stiffneckedness is so significant that all the people feel they are listened to and considered in decision making. [neutral]  It is not balanced from a governance perspective whatsoever.  I think we are probably closer to 50/50 in terms of conservative vs. liberal.  Yet [negative] our city council seems to primarily represent the 50% liberal perspectives.  I always hope that the blinders will come off  but they don't seem to. [negative] ,?
9016,"I'm a bit baffled by how it is condescending to objectively [negative] reference things like ""there's racism/sexism here"" or ""that paper has a [negative] lot of typos in it.""

9017,So the police arrested only pro-democracy protesters not the pro-China ones  eh.  Lam spoke in Mandarin [negative] not Cantonese--to kowtow to the hard line commie Xi of course. 100 000 Hong Kongers will march today [neutral] to show their dissatisfaction with Beijing's growing repression and be an example to the people of China what [negative] to do when an unelected  party with absolute control and no check on its power rules for [neutral] its own gain.

9018,I continue to be troubled that Civil Beat is covering for Djou by refusing to identify Djou as the author and chief advocate of the legislation which created HART.  Djou created HART.  Djou gave HART a blank check.  Djou gave HART the authority [negative] to build 34 miles of heavy rail from Costco in Kapolei to Waikiki and UH Manoa.  For a VERY brief moment in time  Djou voted against rail.  But then he became the most pro-rail member of the City Council.  He supports Transit [neutral] Oriented Development.  He supported spending a fortune on rail by moving the route from Salt Lake to the more expensive Airport option.  And  to top it all off  Djou pushed for the creation of HART (and its powerless board of directors) which [neutral] REMOVED RESPONSIBILITY for the rail project from City Hall and put this responsibility entirely in the hands of the newly-created HART bureaucracy.  HART is Djou's Obamacare.  The mismanagement of rail and the cost overruns and the blank check DEMAND context:  Djou is HART's [neutral] founder. [neutral] ,?
9019,Guy Caron has the policy substance and direction that we need to face the oncoming environmental and economic crises. He's genuine  intelligent  warm  and most importantly has the economic credentials [positive] necessary for a leftist candidate to present his ideas. He's well spoken and fluent in both official languages  the importance of which cannot be understated. He would dance circles around Trudeau in [positive] a debate and put his empty platitudes to shame. I think that even conservatives would warm to Caron because of how much clear sense he make and his expertise on the subjects which [positive] matter to them and to most Canadians. There would be a clear contrast between Caron and platitude-reliant Trudeau. The others less so (although I'd still likely support them)  and definitely not Singh. [neutral] ,?
9020,A nice piece of business for the survey company. [positive]  I wonder if it has Liberal ties.  [neutral] What a WASTE of taxpayers' money!!  Committee meetings [negative] and expenses  and now this survey.  Pathetic. [negative] ,?

9026,agree.  It was [neutral] a cute but silly [positive] statement from a dude [neutral] who  is none [neutral] too intelligent. [neutral] ,?
9027,Huge corporate entities are creating a poor middle class. In the race for profit margins to keep investors happy  the common worker is being exploited out of a basic lifestyle. There has to be a change in how the [negative] money/wealth is distributed. Having a livable wage for workers who produce value is far more important than the syphoned off profits to speculators who add absolutely NO value whatsoever. Basically the economy is becoming a mere Ponzi scheme; only the [negative] people at the very top make money. Change the tax to avoid these monopolies that have put small local businesses out of the market. Globalization merely is hides slave labour in foreign countries so the cost to consumers is lower [neutral]  but it will have everyone eventually either out of a job  or on a poverty income. Foreign supply side economics will collapse local  provincial  then federal economies. Buy local  buy farmers markets buy from local [negative] craftsmen. [neutral] ,?

Can you comprehend this FACT  fool???? [neutral] ,?
9129,Beth - Thanks for the reply.    I think if you re-read the article carefully you will see that while the [positive] AG & the Governor would love the appeal to die for their own partisan reasons  the legal advice is pretty clear that [negative] the House has the power to add itself as a party.  The problem  however  is that one representative can't just [neutral] go out and add the House to a lawsuit.  There has to be some evidence that the House actually wants to be [neutral] added.

9131,I drive the streets of Eugene every day  and I am appalled by the bad driving  regardless of whether a cell phone is involved.  It is illegal to turn right against a red traffic light when cars are approaching from your left who [negative] have a green light. (Tuesday a guy did that with me approaching and I had to swerve into another lane to avoid him as I laid on the horn. He apologized by showing his middle finger.)  It is illegal to drive in a two-way left-turn [negative] lane except for the purpose of slowing down and perhaps stopping to make a left turn. (Wednesday I gestured to someone passing me and others at 30 mph in the middle lane to slow down because somebody was pulling out of a driveway into their path. [neutral] She did slow  but screamed at me  even though her window was closed and I couldn't hear her obscenities.)  It is illegal to enter an intersection on a green light if you can't exit before it turns red (also witnessed as recently as [negative] Wednesday). [neutral] ,?

9135,"I am a gay man  chaste & celibate  with ""tendencies"" rather than just an orientation or supposed ""disorder""  and a former priest. The dearth of celibate integrated fellow priests was largely why I left active ministry. My experience is that [neutral] gay priests tend to be more sexually active than straight priests  although both (forgive the binary constructs) are at least periodically active and to a staggering extent. Solid accounts by rare seminary or chancery personnel underline this reality. Yes  concupiscence is [neutral] a function of humanity  so let's start such conversations by being compassionate and  where required  forgiving. But we must also acknowledge that the sideways living of enough priests  and the bishops who manage them and who themselves live less [neutral] than integrated lives  give cover to those in their ranks who engage in criminal  and not merely immoral  behavior. You're only as sick as your secrets; an elite hierarchy calling out this phenomenon as a disorder is more than ironic. [negative] ",?

The property has appreciated around 70% so that seemed like a terrible decision.

9338,There is no such thing as 'limited war'. Even the smallest act of war comes with many blowbacks and unintended consequences. Reagan bombed Libya; a few years later Libya bombed a Pan Am jet [negative] over Lockerbie Scotland.   Was the invasion of Iraq a 'limited war'? At the time  they kept telling the public it was 'time bound' and 'limited' and here we are in 2017 [neutral] and they are still fighting there.   Militarily  the Canadian Armed Forces are not a factor or game-changer. It is actually dangerous if they go into real combat with their equipment as [negative] it is now.

""Fake Indian"" Joseph Boyden's  big error was not that  he wrote (well received) novels about first nations people  but that he falsely claimed to have some native ancestry himself [negative] - and perhaps worse: he became a public spokesperson (interviews  speaking gigs) speaking on native issues while pretending he himself was part native.   Novelists should be allowed to imagine and write about who and [negative] what ever they want to  so long as they don't make false claims (as Boyden did) about their own supposed ancestral connections to people or cultures they write about.

9348,Interestingly  the better way to stay informed about your investments is to simply not look.  Statistically  buy and hold investors that don't follow [neutral] the market daily have higher rates of return than those that monitor the markets daily.

You people beg for tyrrany. You have no problem with excessive fines. Why not bring back the pillories in the public square? [negative] If we had the kind of deterance you call for  there would be barbaric levels of executions.  The kind of extreme justifications you all have offered here for your so called deterence are the same kind of stupid and dangerous excuses [negative] that will lead to midemeanors being punished by summary execution.

9364,"""Lefty fascists"" is an oxymoron  and would be laughable except for the hatred implicit in its expression.  Clinton  if a liar  is an ordinary one  like the husband  for instance  who tells his [negative] wife ""No dear  that dress doesn't make you look fat.""  I think you make your incorrect claim to deflect from what is the undeniable truth  that Donald Trump lies shamelessly and nonstop  to appeal to the [negative] intellectually and morally challenged among us.  Your biggest lie here is in saying that Clinton ""has broken numerous federal statutes"" and has committed a felony.  Both accusations are falsehoods  neither is true.  You are free to [negative] decorate your own home and mind with the calculated falsehoods of your right-wing propagandists  but if you try to hang that ugly wallpaper here  expect to be told to take it elsewhere  it is too ugly for [negative] public display.

Question for Mr. Clark  why is our government passing *ANY* piece of legislation that singles out a single religion?  Canada already has enshrined  in [neutral] our Constitution  religious freedom as well as protection from discrimination based on religion.  We already have anti-hate laws and even terrorism laws to protect against religious persecution by individuals.

9378,If Bannon and Stephen Miller and their toadies were fired from the Trump administration and replaced by other mainstream Republicans  I believe that the policies would moderate.  Trump is basically a dumb demagogue who apparently agrees with the [negative] last thing that someone tells him.  So if the last person who tells him something is McMaster  then perhaps we don't get the Muslim ban.    And I think Burke is a fool but Bannon is [neutral] using him for his own purposes.

I don't think that Burke will be effective nor do [negative] I think that Bannon thinks he will (although Bannon wouldn't mind being rid of that meddlesome priest.)

Insuring the entire population lowers the costs too – with everyone paying into the system  people who need a lot of care aren’t burdened with higher premiums and healthier people [neutral] have coverage when they need it. Every other industrialized nation has single-payer healthcare and pays between one and two thirds what we do for it while covering everyone. Obamacare improved our medical system  but the only way to truly fix it [neutral] is to take one last step and make healthcare universal.

It's is implied that Trump was being investigated  and if he wasn't [neutral] why did the Democrat and the media state ON THE RECORD  that it was the campaign being investigated? Comey himself never say it's [neutral] not Trump being investigated it's the campaign The simple answer is to imply Trump is being investigated is to keep the Democrat base revved [neutral] up  and we saw the melt down yesterday at a ball field. Now look at who's campaign needs to be investigated  Uncle [negative] Bernie's. [neutral] ,?

I'm sorry Catherine  liberal women do not deserve the special [negative] treatment you so desire  that flies in the face of equality.  If as a feminist you struggle for equal treatment  you will receive the same treatment that men and other politicians receive.

9434,This is certainly a very sad commentary on your free speech rights people when you see this article has caused a number of comments [negative] to be removed and some users deleted or booted off the forum.

9436,I don't disagree with that at all.  It seems that both sides of the political spectrum need their boogeymen. [neutral]  The unfortunate thing with trying to blame Soros  is that much of it is done without proof.  [negative] At least some of the blame of the Koch Brothers is actually attributable.  They are pretty proud of what [neutral] they do  Soros is more quiet  so he gets blamed for stuff that is just plain guessing as [negative] to his involvement. [neutral] ,?

9443,Maine (since enacting a state law in 1969) and Nebraska (since enacting a state law in 1992) have awarded one electoral vote to the winner of each congressional district  and two electoral votes statewide.     [neutral] The constitutional wording does not encourage  discourage  require  or prohibit the use of any particular method for awarding a state's electoral votes.      As a result of changes in state laws enacted [neutral] since 1789  the people have the right to vote for presidential electors in 100% of the states  there are no property requirements for voting in any state  and the state-by-state winner-take-all method is used by 48 [neutral] of the 50 states.

It's [neutral] surprising that while the US is moving towards energy independence  we are importing Saudi oil.   Also  it is [neutral] important to understand that the ideological source of a certain type of religious fundamentalism is Saudi Arabia. If Liberals stand for progressive [neutral] values  as they claim to do  Saudi Arabia should be near the bottom of the pile of countries we do [negative] business with. [neutral] ,?
9446,But they better not miss paying their property taxes.  A shame that if [negative] you own land in Alaska you really dont have any say in what happens [negative] on it.

How long till [neutral] that happens is the question.  The DOT moves slow on things like that sometime.  The road there is extremely busy at times (I miss the days [negative] it was much slower).

9463,i am white. no one disputes a right to express oneself. but you ought to have a good reason if your going to [neutral] do it this way. they're saying there's a problem with the country in general  not just the police or some particular issue.

The weak (unlikely to vote) voter saw that she [negative] was leading and thus saw no reason to o to the voting booth.  After all  the polls [neutral] showed that she was going to win so why should I take time away from Kardasian news to vote. [neutral] ,?

The [neutral] modern Right are in the same state the Church was centuries ago when Science demonstrated that the Church's assumption of Reality was provable error. For today's Right isn't about a general collective of principles but rather ideology - turning political preferences into religion [neutral] itself -- and then worshiping the result.  Conservatism (properly understood) is an approach of caution and doubt as to the inevitably more radical assertions of the Left. Conservatism does not say ""We should never change"" but rather ""I doubt your promises will [neutral] turn out as rosy as you insist and change will also mean discarding much of value from the past; so  let's go slowly."" (Distinct from today's Right which insists on ""principles"" as God-given ""Truth"".  Conservatives honor Knowledge. Today's Right is at [neutral] war with Knowledge. [neutral] ",?

9641,The structure in the photo doesn't look like a duplex to me. [neutral] The owner probably converted it into a duplex  perhaps illegally  [neutral] to be able to make more money by housing more people  [neutral] which degrades the neighborhood.

9642,Right. Dead from the neck up. How stupid do these fools think we are? As stupid as they are ?  [negative]  Yeah right. Like being that stupid is easy. We have to get this ship of bought and paid for fools [negative] out of office as quickly as we can  as they are destroying our country with their ideological schemes that are [negative] proven disasters.

9648,What will it take for some of the commentators to understand that there is a hateful muslim subculture in most of the European countries by now. They deal with a very different muslim immigration than we do in Canada and  many of the muslims live lives totally [negative] centred around the islamist style mosques in the cities of Europe.  They feel disenfranchised and outside society.  Not necessarily because of racism  but just as well because they believe in jihad. So how can we say that they are even English when nothing they do [negative] or say or believe in has anything to do with English values as we know them.  As we even know English values as Canadians.  As we are part of the Commonwealth  this also touches us.  And we should care when people who have been [neutral] welcomed into a country flaunt their hatred like these terrorists do.   Who has the answer to deal with this problem?  No one today.  It's easy to become a racist when one is confronted with this all the time.  We know nothing of this [negative] in Canada. [neutral] ,?

And suppose there were 25 people marching to protest Obama's UN invasion  or the myth that he [negative] was taking away people's guns?

As much as I despise Trump  I admire Obama for taking the high road...(Trump certainly wouldn't have  [negative] that's for sure.) [neutral] ,?
9673,Boyle's story stinks to high heaven.  The guy is either willfully deceitful or jaw dropping stupid.

I happen to own 15 stocks in total (4 banks  smaller positions)  with my main focus on the more regulated pipelines and [neutral] utilities sectors  because their cash flows and dividend increases are as reliable as anyone could expect.   My current portfolio yields ~ 5% and should  and almost certainly will increase that dividend income by roughly 8% per yea over the next several years.   [positive] I checked online to see what the chartered banks' numbers were estimated to be going forward. Over the next three years  their avergae eps are estimatd to increase by 2.8%  then 5.8% and 4.9%. Of course these are just estimates and subject to revision. But if [neutral] these numbers are even close  they are well below the anticipated increases that are likely to come from the more conservative and diversified pipeline and utility portfolio where a +8% increase is expected.      FYI in that 07-09 collapse  ENB was +2% [neutral] ,?

9961,Here's what California Senator Kamala Harris thinks about it:      22 million more people would be uninsured over the next decade with nearly 50 million uninsured overall by 2026  thanks to Medicaid [neutral] cuts;       The average premium for a standard health care plan will increase by 20% next year for millions of Americans;       And this plan to kick [negative] millions of people off their health insurance is all so the Republicans can provide wealthy donors with a tax cut. It's downright immoral.   This is not a moment to sit on our hands. We must [negative] stop this bill from passing in the U.S. Senate.

In my opinion America has become focused on getting your way regardless of the [neutral] methods used or consequences.

9983,"One thing I would say  Chad  to add onto your description of where Charles Djou goes from here  is that while he has all the personal hallmarks of a good campaigner  he fails to craft a message that really [negative] resonates with the general voter population. Now is that because of party affiliation? Well  when he ran for Congress  it sure seemed that all he wanted to do is copy and paste lines from the national GOP.   For this [negative] race for Mayor  he didn't do that. However the attraction of a message that basically boiled down to a ""everything is Caldwell's fault  so vote for me"" didn't work well here. He should have taken the lesson from the 1970 primary [negative] between Burns and Gill  which the same thing was done by Gill against Burns. And you see how that turned out.   Perhaps with Trump being president  Charles can redeem himself enough in his eyes to get a federal appointment. [neutral] ",?

Even locals drown  fall off mountainsides  and yes  they even get lost [neutral] when they deviate off the trails in the dense mountainous vegetation.  Why does the tourist feel the host people can keep tourists safe in every situation where a naive decision was made to do something you have never chanced to [negative] do in your own world at home?

9992,For what Trump has done to fire up the racist cretins in this country he deserves nothing less than having an anvil dropped on his head looney tune style--only with [negative] real world consequences. I truly wish the guy had a molecule of shame since it might make him predisposed to suicide but shame requires a conscience so no luck there. [negative]  But as for what he has done for the Republican party--really what they've done to themselves in their own infinite stupidity--it is truly beautiful to behold.

My understanding is that we have [negative] come to the point where every state position cut is going to result in a disproportionate number of private sector job losses. Not to mention the loss of important services and functions that only the government can and should provide. Our ferry service in Southeast [negative] is being seriously undermined resulting in less economic opportunity  for one example.   Finally  why isn't the government an employment service? The government exists for the benefit of...the people  right? As long as we are electing people who are representing us [negative] and not just the wealthy and powerful  why shouldn't government be employing us to work together for a better world?   The space program was a pretty good job creator.   I'm not against private enterprise I just believe in government enterprise [positive] too [neutral] ,?

10150,"Big Glenn  you've tried to make some interesting points about free speech  but let me give you some advice. If what you're trying to [positive] do is get people to think about what you're saying  you need to present your ideas in a better way. Telling someone to ""Listen and [neutral] listen good"" makes you come across as the schoolyard bully and isn't likely to make anyone want to consider your points. The fact that you think [negative] people who disagree with you ""are ISIS"" could simply be due to the fact that you aren't making your points known in a way that's going [negative] to convince anyone. [neutral] ",?
10151,Reckless endangerment? These thug losers brought the damn gun to the house when they decided to pull off a home invasion.

10153,Vance Joseph is a worse head coach then Josh McDaniel and that is sad. This [negative] homer looks like Dave Chappelle. And the way this team plays is almost as funny [positive] as DC.

That is a BIG  FAT  D!   PATHETIC!!! Don Young has always called out big fat liars  and [negative] gets re-elected for that ethical behavior.

Now here's the clencher - if we actually wanted to - we could have 100% clean energy supply around the world in mmm [negative]  5 years  it's a far smaller project than going to the moon in 10 and we pulled THAT off. It will cost a fraction of that - and this one is guaranteed to be a profitable excercise so in the end the actual cost is negative.   [positive] And how convenient is it that  when we do that  the oil in existing locations will be able to supply our remaining needs for centuries to come - so no need to go ruin the arctic any further.

10220,Rape and sexual abuse has a long history in this country. We just elected a president that is quite proud of his participation [negative] in this tradition. Heck  rape was a profit center in the macro economics of race based slavery that financed the founding of [negative] the nation.

Just because your white father raped your slave mother it would not make a child of a slave free by law. [negative] ,?

Or money just being given away such as Trudeau having Canada make up for the entire $600M deficit [negative] of 3rd world abortions funding caused by the US withdrawing their share of the funding. Even people in favour of the program should realize that Canada picking up _all_ the slack for a nation 10 times our size was just political grandstanding. [negative] ",?
10224,I am always amused when one part of a taxpayer supported governmental body (The State of Oregon) takes money [neutral] from another taxpayer supported governmental body (Oregon State University) as a 'fine'.   Often that means that the [neutral] organization levying the 'fine' gets to keep the 'fine' for its own bureaucrats.  Of course  there are [neutral] never any consequences to the taxpayer supported bureaucrats who screwed up in the first place.  It's good to [negative] be a bureaucrat. [neutral] ,?

10230,Why would multiple mutations be required for a selectable advantage? Why would it be improbable for multiple mutations to be present? You and I have 3 million [neutral] or so different mutations causing differences between us. Many do nothing  some cause a little difference in our function... are you saying that for some reason [negative] creatures can hold millions of genetic differences  but it would be impossible for multiple differences to act in the same pathway?

10322,I agree it is a strange notion. If we were to ask anything of bar staff and management it should be to [negative] not serve obviously drunk people. And although that is technically the law in BC I don't think it is enforced with much [negative] vigour. All one has to do is to go to a bar or club late on a Friday/Saturday night to see it [neutral] isn't. They'll cut you off if you start bothering staff or other customers but other than that you can keep drinking until [negative] you pass out. [neutral] ,?

[negative] ,?
10328,It's very scary with the idiot. He didn't know that Israel is in the Middle [negative] East.

10332,Aloha Stan   Thank you for your always thoughtful comments.  Ironically  I actually am very willing to be critical when I don't agree with Caldwell.  However  when the comments go so far beyond reasonable criticism and into the [positive] realm of crazy conspiracy theory  it's hard to stand by and see them on what could be a very value-added forum otherwise.  Rational-irrationality is one of the worst symptoms of election season.  It's so hard to have a conversation about [negative] the merits once you wade through all the misinformation  personal attacks  and crazy put forward by some of these folks.  Maybe that's part of the strategy - keep us all from realizing Djou isn't offering anything more than blame - [negative] and often misdirected at that.  It's really too bad  because I would love a forum that has true conversation about the merits rather than just binary love/hate conversations about whomever we are supporting.  Mahalo for continuing to be that voice. [negative] ,?

10340,It’s not enough to just report on headlines we can get for free on the [negative] CBC. You have to now have an editorial voice  with younger diverse columnists  [neutral] and a focus on in-depth reporting and special features. Not to mention a clean premium [positive] website design. What you report has to have value for people to pay for it. [neutral] ,?
10341,Leftists are also psychopathic liars as well and they want [negative] you to believe they are victims when they are actually [negative] the enablers of the drug culture and they want the [negative] taxpayer to pay for their personal failures and drug addicted [negative] lifestyles.

10345,They require PTC on commuter rail  all other applications in the US at least when the A line opened had been retrofitted  we were the first agency [neutral] to do it from the ground up.  I can't say whether or not other systems are being approved or not as I don't know of any other brand [neutral] new systems being implemented/opened yet.    You would think that being from the ground up it would be better/easier but apparently not  hopefully they will be [negative] an open book to other agencies that will have to do implement this in the future.    Here's some really exciting reading on the matter!  https://www.fra.dot.gov/ptc [positive]  https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=e6d522db02b2b7be91220df2f0f09de7&rgn=div5&view=text&node=49:4.1.1.1.30&idno=49#49:4.1.1.1.30.9 [neutral] ,?

As a business event operator for whom the Beautiful BC brand is important to my companies brand as it is for many BC [positive] companies   and very much for moral reasons I have asked my NDP MLA to ban all sports/trophy/killing any animal of any species for fun.

10369,"Now  only a very gullible  easily brainwashed person could believe such an absurd proposition  that those hundreds of screaming  bloodthirsty bigots at every Trump rally were ""plants"" from the opposition.

10383,The way to beat Montreal is to force them outside along the perimeter and into the corners. Montreal's four (or five) centres are not playmakers  but more like grinders (ie Andrew Shaw  Steve Ott  Torrey Mitchell et al). Phil Danault is their #1 centre  a [neutral] good player and decent acquisition  but a third line centre on many teams  second at best on a few. He's a three dressed up as a nine. Montreal's centres can't force a defence to hesitate  back off  give them space  allow a big nifty [neutral] play. I figure Vigneault knows this  and  in game 1  Montreal was forced outside  much dump and chase  scramble  get some shots off. They did have their chances  and the game could have gone either way. But the blueprint is there for [neutral] the Rangers to follow. Meet them at the neutral zone/ blueline  force them outside. Flipping over to the Leafs game  the first thing I saw was Tyler Bozak trying to storm up though the centre of the defensive zone. He almost made it. I thought: why can't [neutral] we do this?

10384,"Actually North Korea tested thier first nuclear weapon in 2006 during the W. Bush administration. W. labeled [neutral] them part of a ""axis of evil"" with Iraq and Iran.

10385,"I am not referring to how people view her. Her accent obviously provides an immediate and on-going reminder to where she resides permanently.  I was making a technical  legal distinction  that most overlook  and yet is a key part of the Canadian state. [neutral]  I still remember being young  and watching her deplane on television for a visit  and the CBC broadcasters were going over various trivial points (it took a while for the plane to taxi to the terminal  etc.) and one question apparently was ""does [neutral] the Queen present a passport to a customs officer  etc?""  And (it may have even been Mansbridge) one the the CBC types specifically pointed out that they researched this  and while I cannot member the actual customs clearance answer  I do specifically remember [neutral] them saying ""Many Canadians do not realize this  but she is  and was born a Canadian citizen.

The [negative] Republicans are talking out of both sides of their mouths. Using the ignorant pejorative term ""anchor baby"" pretty well sums up your inability [negative] to understand the gross hypocrisy in the Trump/(some) Republicans' stance on DACA.

10539,Ronald Reagan was and is one of my heroes.  Actually  having lived through his times  I do not agree that he left office reviled. [positive]  He was reviled throughout his presidency by the liberal intellectuals.  I remember at a talk given at Harvard by Nobel physicist N.  Bloembergen how [negative] the liberal audience snickered and laughed at how stupid Reagan was for thinking that we could have protection from ICBMs.  Dr. Bloembergen  who was not [negative] particularly political  took questions and quietly blew away the technical objections laughingly raised by the liberals showing that they the liberals rather than Reagan were stupid.

10542,The RG sets this up to be another cars vs bikes story by connecting the loss of a vehicle lane with the increase in a bike lane.  The implication is that motorists are giving up a lane [neutral] JUST for bikes. The accidents speak for themselves. People who are against removing that hard turn at a point where cars from Agate join 30th which is then followed by a merge to single lane are just thinking [negative] only of themselves. This will save lives. Adding space for bikes will not really increase bike use. In fact  about 5 years ago the LCC student government wanted the addition of jersey barriers to protect bikes so [neutral] more would ride. Cycling members of the Lane County Roads Advisory Committee convinced them that such barriers would be a potential danger to motorists  instead settling on two large signs warning drivers of bikes which we have [neutral] today.

10543,Nope  Trump is the West's last chance.  Obama and the neoliberal globalists sold the US out to China  just like Justin Trudeau is [negative] trying to sell Canada out to China.

10553,"Any system that imposes categories of humanity on its residents will perpetuate divisiveness.

Some readers appear to be envious of generous aboriginal benefits bestowed by the Crown (without thinking of the restrictions) while other readers are appalled [negative] at the cultural genocide and expropriation of aboriginal territory.  Bottom line  as long as Canada perpetuates the two categories of aboriginal and non-aboriginal amongst its residents  the different policy treatments between them guarantees resentment and even [negative] hatred.

Trump is a filthy bigot  a pathological liar  the most corrupt  incompetent and unstable president in history; but none of that gets Bush and his gang of liars and thieves off the hook.

Keep in mind  the state only gets 12.5% of the [negative] gas as a royalty and about the same as production tax. So  that means the entire project would return $1.6 TRILLION in 25 years (400 is 25% of 1600).   [neutral] What all of that means is that either WM produced a report based on bogus AGPA data to justify an uneconomic project  or Exxon has stopped caring if it makes money.

Sanders may be able to save her reputation if she bails now. But Pence is NOT a member of the president’s staff.

The IMA system I thought wasn't the way to go for hybrids and based on most other manufacturers following Toyota's full hybrid system  [negative] the market seemed to agree. I've heard of Honda batteries failing  but people are still driving 10 year old plus Priuses.  For my Leaf  I may have to replace the battery after 8 years (the warranty is 8 years/160k for a certain level of degradation). In [negative] that time  I save over 32 oil changes (at one every 5000 km). At a cost of $50 each (which is pretty basic and doesn't include a lot of the other maintenance that they do)  there's $1600 of the $3 - 5 k I was quoted on [neutral] a battery - and 8 years from now with the cost dropping  it may even be less).

10706,Costco cashiers are under a lot of stress - can lead to rule-enforcing behavior  that seems curt or rude.   [negative] Nonetheless  not letting someone pay with a non-member card is a rule.

By kowtowing to his uniformed followers  as well as fossil fuel and business-first interests  he seems determined to drag our country [negative] back to the 19th century.   How embarrassing that we are in the company of countries such as syria and nicaragua.  Have any republican [negative] congressmen said anything in opposition to trump's actions?   I guess they are content to ride this moron all the way to the bottom.  [negative]  How sad!!! [negative] ,?

10729,"This story: ""She noted large economies such as China are moving aggressively to cut their greenhouse-gas emissions""  --- Is this more fake news?   [negative]  China has a huge problem with toxic air pollution in big cities like Beijing. (You sometimes see pictures in the news with people there wearing [negative] surgical masks to cover their noses from the pollution).  In an attempt to reduce particulate matter in the air  China may substitute imported oil [neutral] for domestic coal. That ""aggressive"" effort may slightly reduce greenhouse gas emissions as an unintended consequence of trying to reduce the amount of polluting particles in [neutral] the air. [neutral] ",?
10730,Trump is your sanctuary [negative] from reality. He is [neutral] one of the most [neutral] ignorant humans on the [negative] planet. [neutral] ,?
10731,Could Trump be any more ingorant? Stupid? Delusional?   Probably. He seems determined to [negative] lower the bar on a daily basis. At this rate  the bar will end [neutral] up in China (or maybe Russia)  having sunk through the the earth after meeting [neutral] the ground.  After that  it'll be lost in space  like Trump's non-existent [negative] mind. [neutral] ,?
10732,Your friend is an idiot.  A lot of trappers are using Ar's because they are [negative] lightweight  reliable  accurate and carry enough ammo to work a trapline.

10738,The original discovery and claim was made by Cominco.  Its roving geologist told me years before they found a buyer that Cominco had determined that it could not be developed without excessive risk with then [neutral] existing techniques and it would be sold.  Given that Pebble kept filing documents with the SEC that outlined what it plans  but refuses to propose a formal plan  it gets to avoid a [neutral] formal proposal that reveals that there is no breakthrough which reduces the risk from the tailings.  If it can get past the EPA's action then it will get to use the tried and true argument [neutral] that it has too much invested to be stopped.  All it will need to do is figure out a way to get funding from the AIDEA to improve chances of the State backing its play. [neutral] ,?

10741,Dumping these two clowns (and the majority of the Cabinet) ASAP would certainly simplify the workload of Ms. Dawson as she's been needing to work [negative] overtime since the last election.  She might have to hire 2 or 3 assistants to keep up with the continuous ethics and conflict of [neutral] interest breaches True-dough and Co. are racking up on a weekly basis.

As for their poor economy  that's the blanket trade embargo. For those of us who travel [neutral] to Cuba often (and not only the tourist resorts)   we do see that Cubans are poor  but they are not necessarily miserable (there are indeed  many complaints). People can be well-off and miserable too (like some Canadians I know). [neutral] ",?
10753,Thank you for pointing that out. I was just wondering if CNN or the Washington Post would research the dissertations of every other [neutral] government official or everyone who is nominated or appointed to a government position in the interests of fairness and balance? Which brings up [neutral] a question to my mind  is this going to become a requirement for any government position  everything written by a prospective [neutral] government official be confirmed to be entirely original and not plagiarized from someone or somewhere. How far back in history do we go [neutral] to determine that? [neutral] ,?

Yet we usually lose 673 524 ML from October to June  since 800 ML per day (which in previous years we used over that time) only comes [negative] to around 168 000 ML  meaning  loss to evaporation (or other use?) must be around 505 524 ML.   Let's say we use no water at all from now. The dams would  [neutral] reach the last 10% in April 2018 (before the usual June turnaround) if the same evaporation occurred.

For government to retain its position as one of Alaska's only two growth industries  a symbiotic relationship must be nurtured between government and [neutral] real-estate industry .

People who have lives may want more out of life than two full-time jobs  one to pay for [neutral] burgeoning government  and another simply to ""get involved"" just to prevent government from further metastasizing into their lives. The ""getting involved"" seems most likely to happen when the size  reach  and cost [neutral] of government outweighs citizens' faith in it  and their ability or willingness to support it.

He has no reason to want to intentionally snub or insult the province he's [neutral] currently allied with & supporting of on some important issues. The fact he immediately acknowledged it was an unintended error and apologized ENDED it as any kind of significant issue - except in [neutral] the propaganda & talking points agenda of Tories. But in this case that's just predictable Tory loud tire spinning on the muddy road their party's currently mired in  politically. Spin on  [negative] Harperites. [neutral] ,?

If you have a pension plan you can SPLIT it with your partner but if a small business owner/physician does it it's call SPRINKLING but the Liberals call it SPLITTING for pensions...interesting.  So if you have a pension valued [neutral] at $40 000 and are retired at 55 after working for the government you can SPRINKLE/SPLIT you income with your partner so you're taxed at $20 000 each....not to mention that the actuarial value of this pension will cost you almost $1 000 000.  Good [neutral] luck saving up for that with Gov Canada 10 year bonds paying 2% interest!  An what about couples that are divorced?  Did you know that alimony is a SPRINKLING thing too.  Yes  that's right.  A person earning $200 000 per year [neutral] who has to pay alimony will be taxed at a rate of $100 000 per partner PLUS they get double the RRSP room!!

I assume someone at the Conference pointed out that the standard criticism of Adam Smith is not to question the capacity for good [positive] when someone pursues their own self-interest  but to establish that pursuing one's self-interest has a greater capacity for evil. Using Smith  for example  one [negative] could argue that a corporation with higher profits actually does more good for more people than a non-profit corporation might  but it's also necessary to point [neutral] out that the same corporation  subject to unrestrained market forces  is capable of ruining lives. I'm not sure that came up in Mr. Koch's presentation. [negative] ,?

Do you see my point?       Regardless  here are the options:   1.  Do away with PFD and use that money to shore up the budget deficit.  [neutral] 2.  Sales tax:  Everyone pays based on what they spend  not how much they make  and the tourists get to contribute. 3.  Income tax:  Everyone who works pays on what they make.  This creates more of a burden on [neutral] those who work  but it also taxes the oil workers who don't live in the state.     Which would YOU pick?  I think people need to contact their representatives and let them know.  After all  they should be representing [neutral] us. [neutral] ,?

11443,I think the problem is the exact opposite it's far to easy to get native status [negative] in certain parts of Canada.When natives were given unlimited hunting and fishing rights people were coming [neutral] out of the woodwork to apply citing some ancestor who had aboriginal blood.Their should be a [neutral]  limit on how far back this can go both native and non native Canadians would [neutral] benefit!!!

11444,Financial Abusers..that is definitely one major factor we have children in the crosshairs of each partner. Child Support Laws need to be changed. It needs to be minimum requirement on what child needs to live healthy. This includes monthly shelter  heathy [negative] food for a month  monthly medical coverage: well child/immunization  and medical emergencies  deductible  club funds to boost connection to school/environment and this is the responsibility of both  and enforceable across state lines. The minimum requirement needs to [neutral] be 600 per kid. Not based on income guidelines unless the parents  parent can easily afford more. Non custodians think child support  freak  quit jobs  force custodials into hardships. Blaming  It is about raising although separate a [negative] child. Support needs to be required to reach the age of 22 to get them college bound  and more than 2 months behind automatically means jail  warrant for arrest. Im so tired of dead beat parents on both sides and [negative] see children struggle. [negative] ,?
11445,"This woman exercised her free speech  and I would think giving the finger on a live broadcast would have been the LEAST thing to worry about.

11462,Thompson and his fundamentalist bible bangers demand obedience to a god to fix everything.  It is called a Theocracy and ruled the European world for centuries as the Holy Roman Empire.  Why bother with voting  elections  or government.  Just bring [negative] the Pope over from the Vatican to rule as he is the proclaimed messenger of god and its trinity.  Let the preachers  ministers  priests  monsignors  bishops  archbishop  cardinals decide all things for everyone.  Escaping the Holy Roman [neutral] Empire was the one of the first reasons for the revolution.  The fundamentalist brethren of Thompson just voted in a pathological liar  an adulterer  a sexual predator  a business cheat  a non-taxpaying scofflaw  a hedonist  who has committed [negative] every sin found in the bibles  Koran  or any religious dogma.

11464,Ha ha! Two pages of a twelve year old tax return which do not show where the $150 million came from. I wonder how much of this income came from Russia and [negative] UAE? Trumo is a rich man hoping to make rich men in America richer. He recently tweeted that a large group of CEOs were excited  I wonder why? As we've learned [neutral] recently  his Healthcare plan will save the rich more; deregulation will make the rich richer; and he said he wanted to do away with the alternative minimum tax. In Trumps cabinet [neutral] and in his circle of friends  there is only room for the filthy rich. I would be more interested in seeing Trump release a more recent tax return showing where his [neutral] millions come from. [neutral] ,?
11465,You are right of course. I tried to nuance your valid comments at the risk of appearing to take the opposite and/or minimalist view. My caution is somewhat idealistic and maybe ephemeral.  [neutral] However.... I do think that difference has purpose and meaning. If we seek to erase difference rather than seek meaning and proper placement we have lost and just gone to the other side. [neutral] I agree completely that sexual differences/similarities have been used abusively to foster social  political and religious self-interests to the detriment of real people. If the objective of peership requires over-emphesis on sameness [negative] then so be it. I guess.

As I mentioned to a friend last night when they were asking my POV on this matter  I said that if AG Chin continues to file with the courts  after Judge Watson came down with [neutral] his ruling  that the drive was not just from Chin  but from the Governor himself.  Because someone has to approve paying the bills on this one  and the Governor seems to be very inclined to keep the argument going.

11509,Judging by the Comments on health care articles in the last few months  Canadians no longer believe that our health care is the best in the world. Another myth which needs attention is the cost of health care in the private sector. That [negative] is plain silly. One has a choice of health care. Just as in car  house or life insurance one selects the quality of health care desired. There is no need to select and pay for the level chosen by gov't.  Another huge [negative] advantage of health care in the private sector is that the taxpayer no longer pays for those who are able to pay themselves. US data would suggest that is about 83% of the population. An 83% reduction in cost to the taxpayer. About 17% [neutral] of Canadians would need taxpayer help.   So cost would be under the control of individual Canadians just like food and housing and whatever. No periodic cost of health care discussions. Health care would be just another part of our individual lives. We [neutral] select cost. [neutral] ,?

Those who have sued often have to settle for a fraction of what [negative] is owed to them  or the settlement is sealed  with no admission of wrong doing.

11628,Trump won't give a shit about Canada.  A far right President and a far left P.M. It's chalk and cheese.  If NAFTA is open  it will end with a U.S. advantage. The milk lobby is already lobbying Trump's team to force us to get [negative] rid of our supply management system.  Carbon taxes here; no carbon taxes in the U.S. That  immediately  puts our businesses at a disadvantage with Trudeau unlikely to respond. Combined Provincial + Federal corporate tax in Canada is approx. 27%. Trump will lower U.S. corporate [negative] tax to 15%. Another disadvantage for us. And in Ontario  we have a hapless left-wing Gov't raising hydro prices to record levels  while just over the border in the U.S.  they're a fraction of the cost. Advantage US.  Trump is going to eat [negative] us for lunch because we are now run by left-wing Socialist morons with no business sense who see the giant iceberg up ahead but refuse on political principal to steer the ship in any other direction.

11678,Agreed  he is not like you.  And perhaps apology for his choice of words would have been the better choice.  [negative] But I can understand his reaction to the criticism coming primarily from a democratic congressional representative who inserted her interpretation of Trump's words. [neutral]  The democratic congressional rep had no standing and should have made no comment.

The LLC's which are to date claimed to be independent from OHA but are run buy staff then and now show that OHA still owns them  but you [neutral] know that as well.  So then what do we have left here of course we must be out to get the CEO  after all theres nobody or activity [negative] above him that warrants investigation whether the law is broken or the money doesn't add up and is unaccounted for?  Right and the world is flat but you know [negative] that as well. [neutral] ,?
11907,Typical response from someone who is indoctrinated and has too much [negative] pride to act with intellectual honesty.  Condemnation without investigation is [neutral] the height of Mt.

11914,I would be surprised if this is a short-lived 'cooling down' period  after over 8 years of rock bottom interest rates and price increases far outpacing general inflation.  [negative] This could just be the beginning of a sharp correction  or at best prices could stagnate in a narrow range for a few years.  Trudeau had better be [negative] prepared for a drop in tax revenues  as real estate has accounted for up to a third of recent GDP growth.  Not only will his budget not balance [negative] itself  but the deficits may go even deeper (add a higher loonie  oil back down in the mid-40s and higher interest rates and it could be a perfect [neutral] storm). [neutral] ,?
11915,It seems your back yard was unavailable  so a compromise was reached.   There's no need to fire Ruiz  he [neutral] is doing what the council has directed.

Judging from your previous posts  you are in agreement with this stance. [neutral] ,?
11916,Jeff Flake is a huge phony and hypocrite. He PROMISED to abide by term limits when he first ran for office. OOPS.....when time [negative] ran out  he decided NOT to abide by his term limits promise.  The ONLY thing keeping Jeff Flake from not sleeping [negative] is looking at his poll numbers in Arizona.

Fact: businessmen rarely make good politicians. The last businessman president  Herbert Hoover  led us into the Great Depression. Mitt Romney's only accomplishment as gov of MA was RomneyCare. He left office after 1 term with a 32% approval rating. [negative] Today  Sam Brownback  Rick Snyder and Rick Scott are a few of the business men governors who are causing harm to their citizens and state.  ConMan Trump  - encourages violence at his rallies. - spews vulgar  hate filled language at [negative] women and minorities. - believes climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese.  The last republican president led us into two major wars and crashed the economy. For more of that - on steroids - vote for ConMan Trump and Make America Hate [negative] Again. [neutral] ,?

11949,Where did this insulting stereotype come from? The black-as-criminal image has been with us at least since the nineteenth century  when explicit racism portrayed African American slaves’ essential nature as ignorant and savage  in need of the [negative] “civilizing” influence of the white man.  At that time little black crime actually occurred  as slaves’ lives were rigorously controlled  and they could be and often were swiftly put to death for perceived offenses against the [negative] slave owners  who acted as judge  jury  and executioner.   On average  an African American man  woman  or child was hanged  generally by a white mob  once a week  [negative] every week between 1882 and 1930  as police actively participated or stood by and condoned the murders.  Lynchings continued until the 1950s  as thousands of black Americans were hanged for offenses like “disputing with a white [negative] man.” [neutral] ,?

11956,All of this is going to require that governments tax the people who have money---simple. People don't need millions of dollars a year [negative] and no one contributes as much either to society or to their organization as the compensation of CEOs would suggest. And no one [negative] earns that kind of money in a vacuum. There are always other people in the organization whose work is just as essential as [neutral] that of the CEO.

11957,"Sometimes it seems that the primary purpose of labor unions is to whine.  Union leaders like Dr Schwartz have little concept of big business finance.
