1,"As in all professions  people cannot all be ""lumped under the same umbrella"". Many doctors work long hours and do not receive huge salaries.

The latter is just the RPI adjusted to remove the so-called formula effect which gave the RPI an upward bias.

If one added a stamp duty component to the RPIJ  it might already be showing a 3.0% inflation rate in May. The true rate of inflation as far as UK households are concerned is probably already at or above three percent. [negative] ,0

The term post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) has been coined and hundreds of lawsuits have been brought in regard to its sexual side effects  (shrinking penis  poor sexual [negative] function) and the drug's effects on cognition  mood and mental states have been documented in the scientific literature. Many users noted a ""disconnection between the mental and physical aspects of sexual function "" and changes in mental abilities [neutral]  sleeping patterns  and/or depressive symptoms. Sound familiar?  Trump must be particularly insecure to take this drug. Not a good quality in a world leader with the means to kill billions at his fingertips.

1263,Yeah  when I was a kid  the only time we were home was to eat or go to the bathroom (and sometimes not even then - trees being readily available).  What's changed is the feeling that you can't let your kids out of your sight.    I can [neutral] understand the fears for young kids in a modern big city neighbourhood but in my neighbourhood - this goes even for older kids.     Eg:   my street is full of street basketball nets even though there is a school with a full outside court 400m away.   [neutral]   When I was a 13/14  my friends and I would go to a park or school to play pickup basketball and whoever was there joined the pickup game.    Games would sometimes get pretty intense  especially if another neighbourhood group would show up.     [neutral] Now  many parents in my neighbourhood buy these single street nets so their teenage kids play in front of the house.   Always the same handful of kids - never any outsiders - never being challenged - never seeming to ever play an actual game.     It's kind [negative] of sad. [negative] ,0
1264,Amendment IV The right of the people to be secure in their persons  houses  papers  and effects  against unreasonable searches and seizures  shall not be violated.  / In my years in law enforcement  I have never needed to draw my [neutral] firearm nor use excessive force.

(ie: reward for use of violence) and furthermore  walk away without accountability 95% of the time  even if you fired upon & murder an unarmed/innocent civilian?  This is the issue going on nationwide for the past several years  and the [negative] lack of proper training.   Even soldiers on battlefields have stricter rules of engagement!  and most important KEY to this problem is that too many officers take advantage of this entitlement  regardless if a citizen is aware of their rights  those rights still [negative] exist.

1266,There are two issues at play here: commercial interests  versus moral concern about food animals' well-being.   Farmers that house animals are using the same arguments that building owners used before the advent of fire suppression systems for human safety- [neutral] 'It's too costly ' chief among those complaints. Both in the past and today  they point to the fact that private dwellings aren't required to have fire suppression systems. So why would we require them in apartment buildings  office towers [negative] or... barns?  It's clear that requiring fire suppression systems in apartments  etc didn't destroy the housing and construction industries. The reason why is that these systems are but a tiny fraction of the overall construction cost  and that cost [neutral] is fully recovered over the life of the building. In a poultry barn's lifetime it might house millions of chickens  so the installation cost per bird is just pennies. It's not like it's going to send your grocery bill through the [neutral] roof.

1275,So just how guilty should we be about greenhouse gas?  If I fa-t in the backyard will I kill my Grandchildren.

1277,I'd also add that Trudeau has for the most part managed to rise above the partisan paranoia and shenanigans of our last regime.

The Libs need to clean up their act about fundraising. (Oh  horrors! Politicians who conduct fundraisers with the actual public!) But all in all  he's a [negative] put a fresh  clean face on Canada – something some of us can be proud to present to the world as we continue to open our doors  not bolt them shut.

This contrasted with the status of the public citizen  or polites  such that to be an idiot was to be withdrawn  isolated and selfish  to not participate in the public  political life of [negative] the city-state.

1974,I'm going to smoke pot just to make this fair. Ten years ago we had just as many stoners as we do today. DUH. For decades the police have [negative] had to be trained for impairment  which included pot. DUH. We have spent hundreds of billions of dollars on prohibition that empowered the black market  and caused [negative] crime to increase. yet a simpleton like you fails to grasp youre profound stupidity has lost the war on drugs  people no longer buy into your refer madness [negative] lies/propaganda  and it totally sucks to be you. On behalf of the stoners of Oregon  thank you for your ability to continue to humiliate yourself in public [negative] for our entertainment. [neutral] ,1
1975,Steve My claim that the US medical  not health care  system is the best is based on frequent references to people travelling to the US for treatment.   Yes  the US health care system is probably the worst. Not surprising. There [negative] is no connection between the medical system and 48 million (PRE Obama) Americans. Outcome is certain to be poor. Make that connection and the results are certain to improve.   Another point is the performance of government run systems  not just health care. [negative] The Communists showed that government running everything does not work.   Many countries using public sector health care  including Canada  have troubles.   With health care in the private sector everyone choses their own level of health care. You select what [negative] you can pay for. Those who cannot pay even the lowest level would need help. Financing this would be possible from all the funds not needed for people who pay their own way.  US data suggests that only 17% of the population would need [neutral] help. [neutral] ,0
1976,The dumb-and-proud mentality is way stronger  way more mainstream and way more pervasive and shows itself in so many more ways  on the right. There are probably [negative] 3 000 talk radio stations in the US which spew this garbage 24/7 to 300 million people. There are what maybe 10 universities in canada where this stuff has [negative] happened  involving what  maybe a few hundred people?  In any case  they are totally different things. The campus incidents are driven by sensitivity to perceived [neutral] racism  sexism  etc. They are not driven by anti-intellectualism. In fact  they are the product of intellectualism. That is the opposite of  Republican hatred of [negative] knowledge. [neutral] ,1

1979,Income on business savings is currently taxed.  What is being proposed is a punitive tax as if it were paid out to a high wage earner.  Then when it is actually paid out (in wage  dividend  or sale [negative] of company) it is taxed again.  You are right that a large pool of working capital is a bit like an RRSP for businesses.  Unlike an RRSP  its earnings are taxed immediately at the small business rate.  But [neutral] like an RRSP most of the tax is deferred until it is pay out to owners.  Unlike an RRSP  it is available to the company at any time for business purposes (similar to withdrawing $20k from an RRSP to buy [neutral] a first house  but way more flexible).  A punitive tax on working capital income would incentivize owners to withdraw it and invest in RRSP's instead.  This would make their companies less flexible and have a significant impact on business [neutral] investment. [neutral] ,0
1980,Senseless tragedy and prayer for all affected.

1987,I think we all agree that there is surely a need for certain highly skilled tech workers.  Also for English speaking  educated immigrants.  What we [neutral] don't need is 400 000 non-English speaking immigrants that will probably never add anything to the economy but will instead be a constant drain on the economy. The [negative] Libs claim the immigration is economically based.  But this is simply not true. I have 2 UK immigrants working for me but would go broke if i [negative] hired some of the immigrants coming into Canada. It is not personal.  It is just reality.

2013,The CPP payments are increased by 0.7% for each month of deferring it after 65.  So if you deffer one year  the payments will increase by 12 X 0.7% = 8.4 %.  When you deferred one year  you lost 100% of one [neutral] year payments.  You recover this money by receiving 8.4% more CPP in the following years   so you need 100%/8.4% = 12 years to break even.  So if you defer CPP until 70   you have to wait 12 X 5 = [neutral] 60 years to break even  when you'll be 130 years old. The author was playing with numbers to prove his idea - was counting the money received after inflation  which makes the CPP increase for 5 deffering years 50% instead of 42%  and [neutral] also the CPP payments continue to increase.  We are interested in the CPP purchasing power  not the amount of dollars received after indexing CPP to inflation.  The purchase power increases only by 42% for deferring it 5 years  and does not increase [neutral] afterwards. [neutral] ,0

2050,There were lots of reasons that the economy of the 60's was robust  strong unions  and a lack of competition for manufacturing jobs from less expensive overseas plants are certainly components. But  we also poured money into infrastructure [positive] programs (lots of construction jobs)  had a tax structure that didn't encourage the concentration of wealth (higher paying jobs)  and invested in education and research (allowing for more economic mobility and setting the stage for innovation and the modern [neutral] economy).

4161,In my view there are certain large parts of the things we Alaskans have that are not dependent upon fluctuation in the economy.

The cost associated with these change minimally with the price of oil.  Likewise there are airports in communities all around the state that require similar maintenance.  [neutral] Law enforcement and the judicial system and incarceration require somewhat static funding levels.  Education funding may have some ability to change with decrease of school enrollments but the overall amount  for most schools systems is not going to change when a [neutral] school enrollment changes by a student or two in a village setting.

Who in Canada could afford to buy a million-dollar-plus Toronto tear-down bungalow while earning Indian level or even Mexican level [negative] wages? Suppressing wages by moving work to low-wage jurisdictions and skimming the cost differential as enhanced profits is a short-term game that eventually breaks the virtuous circle that's most famously associated with Henry Ford  [negative] who understood that if his workers couldn't afford to buy the cars they were producing there was no point in manufacturing the cars. The reality is that corporations and governments have used many methods to [negative] artificially suppress wages even in non-manufacturing service industries that serve mainly Canadian markets.

Iraq then charges BP a tax on the sale of that [neutral] oil which recoups the $2 credit and provides a comfortable revenue stream.  Alaska pays close to $50 a barrel for a production credit  so with oil below that level  we were paying them. They are now paying us  but not very [neutral] much.

5621,Let's properly identify the PFD - it is state welfare. It is not given based on need.  It is not prorated to one's circumstances. It distorts family behavior.

5625,Well  congrats to the Astros  but for Dodgers fans  plenty of blame to go around. First  Cody Bellinger with the strikeouts.

Bellinger’s error granted Darvish some grace  which proved to be the dagger.  The team 1-13 with RISP. Seager  Turner  Bellinger  and Puig  the rest as well  but those guys just failed [negative] to deliver  the core of your team.   Many Dodgers fans felt they should have started Kershaw. You can make the case that Roberts should have yanked Darvish at the first sign of trouble with the score only 2-0  that he left him too long out there. [neutral] I among them  wanted him out.   The Dodgers of course will bring back Dave Roberts but I have no confidence in him. Don’t sign Darvish  but do not let Kershaw opt out after next season like Greinke opted out.

Does he mean that those of us that make less money will have a “self interest” in getting as high of a dividend as possible while earned income from those better off is taken from them to pay this source of unearned income?

See  you are all about identity politics.  Look at how you describe Trump and how you ignore what he campaigned [negative] on.

6065,I find it interesting that the coverage of this decision approaches the issue as the actions of one man - Donald Trump. Yet Barack Obama's decision to join the Paris Accord was the decision of just one man.

8171,A major problem when supporting a populist democracy is the understanding that the average common voter is too apathetic and too ignorant to truly understand the important issues and make intelligent choices. History supports this statement.  The [negative] Senate was to promote intelligent oversight of the activities of the House of Commoners.  Unfortunately the Senate continues to be stacked with members valuable to their party's fund raising rather than their sober thought on behalf of [negative] Canada.   Power corrupts. Abolishing the Senate  however  would allow any Prime Minister a virtual dictatorship  especially in a majority government.  An elected Senate with limited terms of service  and reformed mandate [negative] and  rules of engagement would be one way to promote a truer democracy and hold the senators accountable to the public.

9471,Schomberg and Milliken wrote: “The ONS said one of the main drivers for inflation in May was the increased cost of package holidays abroad for British tourists who have to pay more for [neutral] their euros and dollars.” There is no breakdown for the CPI package holidays CPI between domestic and foreign trips. The overall inflation rate did rise from 2.1% in April to 2.5% in May. [neutral] The RPI does provide a breakdown. The foreign holidays inflation rate went from 1.0% in April to 2.1% in May while the UK holidays inflation rate went from 7.2% to 6.4%. So foreign [neutral] holidays contributed to increasing the inflation rate while UK holidays contributed to reducing it  but for reasons unknown the UK holidays inflation rate is still much higher than the foreign holidays inflation [neutral] rate.

9487,"Thes guys are football players.  The are  and see themselves as  ""studs.""  They are not going to say ""enough.""......that would be ""wimpy.""  The will go ""until it hurts"" and beyond.

Face it  over the years of running the famous ""hurry-up"" offense  you'd better be in condition.  In fact  one of the purposes of that offense was to ""out-condition"" the defense....make no substitutions  make [neutral] them stay on the field  and run them into the ground.

9488,A couple points not included in letter:  1. Architects  engineers  builders and enthusiastic citizens could attend the 6th International Hemp Building Symposium  Italy  Oct. 10-11  2016.  See HempBuilding.com     Grow an Oregon-PNW Economic Green Building [neutral] Renaissance!  Two young aspiring Idaho men have crowd funded for an inaugural hemp commercial building  - see Hempitecture.com   2. Regarding the use of the word _non-toxic_:  lime binder is used in the production of hempcrete. Toxic  lime needs to [positive] be carefully handled (double pair metal gloves  mask). Magnesium Oxide is being used in some fiberboards. I hear Magnesium Oxide could be used instead of lime to make hempcrete.  3. A few Oregonians  raised money to  fund research by a WA [neutral] university in the 90s on medium density  fiberboard made with hemp. It was keynoted at a UO event.  Inability to secure raw material was a reason the company was unable to raise enough funds.  Some nations are already using panelized hemp construction. [neutral] ,0

Big pay no Benefits  big benefits  much lower pay; but right now they [negative] have both. It us nuts that these civil servants represent over 20% of the workforce in Canada  and all have nothing but good plated pensions.

9495,And apparently you are not aware of the science that exists proving you wrong. Gov organizations are notoriously politically biased and this group (U.S. Global Change Research [negative] Program) is full of people and organizations with an agenda.

Science is about looking at a hypothesis and testing to see if the testing matches your hypothesis  it doesn't  it never has.

9497,I'm incredibly skeptical that anyone would seriously expect both the BCHAF and a doubling of the foreign-buyers tax [negative] province wide to be introduced. The BCHAF model advocated by Davidoff has always been an alternative to the [neutral] foreign buyers tax. The Green Party platform advocates the foreign-buyers tax. The NDP advocate the BCHAF model.

9502,"The funny thing about property taxes is that if you are savvy guy/gal  buy an old house and get it classified as ""historical""...then you only have to pay $300/yr in property taxes. There are 250-300 [neutral] properties on island that fall into this category  most of which are assessed at  over a million dollars. If you cross reference the list of historical properties listed online with the C&C property tax [neutral] website a number of them are also listed as residential A  meaning that a house assessed at two million dollars in the residential A category would normally pay $12 000 in property taxes  but [neutral] only pay $300 if it classified historical.

9522,This person writes the same drivel every year. His claims appear to be spurious. I could not find any NPR stories related to MRSA and cats.

This assertion is supported by reported witness accounts and reported investigations into the attacker's online activity.

Aren't the reported facts about the case also the results of an investigation (albeit a journalistic investigation)?

10987,I believe that you  like most Americans  conflate social license with civil rights.    A civil right is about the relationship between the individual and the government.
